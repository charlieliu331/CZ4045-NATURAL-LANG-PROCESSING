and 60s and how it started to turn in the 70s onward to the form it is   
today.""

The problem with this kind of nostalgia is it usually embraces how America was for white male heterosexuals. Sure we may have had less gun violence and the country was doing better economically, but many opportunities and rights were denied people who didn't fit into a very specific box. It was a very dangerous time for some of those people to exist as well. While this country has some serious issues right now, what I really have been happy with the past decade is people are finally openly addressing problems that needed to be taken care of decades (even a century) ago. 

It's also important to realize a lot of the people bitching and moaning for the 50s and 60s are the very people responsible for where we are now. My biggest vice with it is so many of them \*knew\* what was wrong. They had little ""free love"" protests over it. But they let themselves be distracted by greed, cowardice, and depravity—to the point they didn't just screw over the country, but their very own families—therefore I have very little love for the Baby Boomer generation (though there are remarkable individuals in it) and anyone who's obviously from there and griping about where America is does not get much attention from me.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"I’m crying, but I know you don’t need my tears. I’m praying your voice reaches the ears of those who, hopefully, have the wisdom to change how America deals with gun violence! I’m so sorry and angry that this is your reality, and the reality of *children*! I pray for yours and their protection, as well.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Most successful first-world countries have almost completely banned guns. America is the only country that has a gun violence problem because we value guns more than human lives.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"Look at Scandinavian countries too. Many have permitting requirements, but no bans on semi-automatic weapons. Some of those countries actually have fewer restrictions related to specific firearms and firearm accessories. Simply put, an ""assault weapon"" ban won't solve magically solve the problems of our late-state capitalistic oligarchy; sure it will make it harder for someone in crisis from accessing that type of firearm, but there are already an estimated 20 million AR15s owned in America. Gun violence is not going to just stop if there are restrictions placed on very specific firearms that are not even responsible for the majority of gun deaths in this country (ie handguns, and most of those are suicides). Keep in mind that AR 15s wew fully available to the civilian market from 1964 until 1994 and you did not see the same level of violence we have today. Modern American gun violence is a disease of despair just like drug ODs, suicide and alcoholic liver disease. We need to critically examine the root causis of violence.

And gun ownership is a right in this country. It's in pretty plain text. If shit pops off and the fascists successfully capture the capital on their next attempt in 28 months my family will be safe. Will yours?",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"what an incredibly stale and ignorant take on gun violence in America

that little demon in Uvalde bought two guns on his 18th birthday from a gun store, perfectly legal

the piece of shit who shot up Marjory Stoneman Douglas bought his rifle, also 18, also legal. 

the Columbine fucks were given guns by a friend because they were too young to buy them themselves. they went to a gun show looking for private sellers (the ""loophole""). first they were told to come back with someone who was 18, so they came back the next day with an 18 year old and bought two shotguns and a rifle. 

This was also the case for the scared little boy who ran into a crowd of people with a rifle  and then and started shooting as soon as he ""feared for his life."" His 18 year old friend bought him the gun Punk bitch really thought he was gonna go all Call of Duty: Kenosha and come out a hero. Turns out he did.

the outspoken woman-killer from Isla Vista bought *three* guns legally.

the would-be Klansmen who lynched Ahmaud Arbery bought their guns legally. 

if you want to keep talking about ""criminals"" buying guns on the ""black market"" then at least do some research on American firearm deaths, including suicide and NDs (since those kill people too), research accidental firearm deaths of American children, research how much money the NRA pours into Congress' pockets, and then please tell me why having easier access to guns makes us all safer. 

Besides all that, I could swear to God that every time gun fetishists talk about gun control with me, their faces light up as they invite regular everyday citizens to ""just try and take my guns,"" gleefully frothing at the mouth with bloodlust over just the thought of shooting a lib, as if they really think they'd see my disabled ass banging on their door. 

As soon as any motherfucker with a gun ""fears for their life"" the bullets start flying.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"He literally wrote (right after Uvalde shooting):

  
""Every violent death is a tragedy. That said, the mainstream media would have you believe that America is the land of gun violence and mass shootings when, in fact, as   
u /HannahDCox points out, our per capita rates of gun deaths are actually much lower than many other countries.""

22 children died - ""our per capita rates of gun deaths are actually much lower than many other countries.""

""the mainstream media would have you believe that America is the land of gun violence and mass shootings"" - because it is. 329 mln people - 700 mass shootings per year. Europe has over 700 mln people and it had 7 mass shooting (with 3 in russia) in 2021.

On average 316 Americans die EVERY DAY due to civilian gun violence. Which is literally 60% of global daily deaths caused by guns (around \~500 civilian deaths daily globally)

Second Amendment: ""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.""

WELL-REGULATED militia, not a bunch of muh-fredom-rednecks buying AR-15s at Walmart on 2-for-1 sales (yes, I know Walmart no longer sales ARs).

6,"&gt;there are rifles capable of murdering a dozen people in 5 minutes

My brother in christ there are *knives* capable of murdering a dozen people in under a minute. Fun fact: pistols have extended/double stack mags.  You can get a 19 round mag for a glock for $30, and if we pick a very conservative time for drawing on a close target (10 seconds), it could be emptied by somebody who's trained and calm, firing well-aimed shots, in about 3 minutes. 

&gt;Handgun deaths are usually related to crime and poverty

Au contraire, mon ami. For decades, most firearm deaths (the overwhelming majority of which involving handguns) [are suicides](https://usafacts.org/data/topics/security-safety/crime-and-justice/firearms/firearm-deaths/), which indicates mental health issues, not criminality. Even in cases identified as homicide, common motivations such as intimate partner violence or personal vendettas are, again, indicators of insufficient mental health care, not necessarily criminality or poverty. Gang-related violence is massively overblown by popular media and orders of magnitude more black men die serving life in prison than in the streets.

&gt;with a bandaid of getting rid of weapons made for actual wars

Name one handgun (common enough that it's used by those impoverished criminal and gangs) that was not made for ""actual wars"" or law enforcement. The US is one of the only civilian gun markets in the world. Armed forces like guns to be cheap, reliable, powerful, accurate, serviceable in the field, etc. Which of these characteristics would be detrimental in a civilian application? I suppose 'powerful', but a .22 can still kill a person while not reliably stopping a 400lb charging grizzly. Guns are almost always used as weapons, and in practice, it doesn't make much of a difference if the designers imagined you wearing a uniform while using it or not.

In all seriousness, we're in agreement on the important stuff. I really don't like mass shootings. Too many people die from guns in the US, and we're not doing nearly enough to fix that. **However**, the problem is **not** that civilians have access to guns; the problem is that gun culture in America is toxic, far right, and is at worst ambivalent to mass shooters. Switzerland has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world and some of the most lax restrictions, yet has a small fraction as many deaths due to those and (to date) no mass shootings. American gun culture is exceptionally bad, and outright bans on the sale of (any or all) firearms is only popular with moderate dems. Literally everybody else, including much of the far left and especially centrist or mild conservatives, don't like gun bans. It's a wedge issue that lets republicans arm themselves and their communities while keeping democrats dependent on law enforcement and other state actors, *which the right already has disproportionate influence over, and has been trying to win back since Trump*. I'm not saying that having a gun will keep you safe from brownshirts. I *am* saying that I would much prefer that everybody had a gun than only the crazy fucking qanoners and neonazis who have literally, factually, unambiguously, and unrepently, already attempted an armed fucking coup.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"&gt;But you would make it difficult if not outright impossible for future generations to legally keep and own firearms. Costs would continue going up, and being able to train or buy ammunition or new guns would become impossible for people who didn't have the financial means. 

Exactly. Really, I'm just saying it's possible if we wanted to. It's not my favorite solution, but it would be one I would accept because it would be extremely effective. So much so it would likely shrink the *global* gun economy by running many domestic and foreign manufacturers out of legal customers. It would have an interesting effect on South America (cartels source most of their guns through mules from the US). They might have to start buying AKs.

&gt;Instead of blaming the inanimate weapons, perhaps we should try and focus on fixing the underlying causes

Yeah, except Republicans shoot those down too. Solutions like better access to mental healthcare, funding for after school programs, letting the government do research on gun violence, CPS funding, and social safety nets are all help reduce gun violence as a part of a whole host of other benefits. 

The only solution conservatives ever really see or advocate for is more defense in an endless arms race. They'll do lip service to mental health after a mass shooting, but restrict access to it at any other opportunity.

&gt;We have more than enough data and real world policies to show that it doesn't prevent criminals from acquiring weapons illegally and does very little, if anything, to keep individuals within society safe in a way that doesn't also compromise their civil liberties (assuming their government recognizes said liberties to begin with). 

What real world data? Every developed country that has passed gun control has seen a reduction in gun crime.

&gt;What you are proposing is gross overreach and completely unconstitutional to begin with. Not to mention that the 2nd amendment has nothing to do with hunting or sport shooting whatsoever. 

Yeah, it's based on the idea of checking the federal government, which is just stupid, even in the time of the founders. 

&gt;No, what you want is overreach and more government involvement, and that is where our differences are. As long as you support this, we have nothing further to discuss, frankly.

I genuinely am concerned about domestic terrorists, especially now.

If I didn't honestly think it would reduce deaths and help protect our democracy, what other possible reason could I have to give a shit?",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"It's a difference in attitude. America holds personal rights in higher value than what brings the best results for society as a whole. Australia thinks of it the other way around, putting the needs of society as a whole before personal desire. I'm just stating the spirit that was behind the law change mate. Regardless of what you think about it, that's why it was done.

Are there still gun crimes? Yes, but not anywhere near the same quantity as in the USA. Do we have mass shootings which include uninvolved victims like what has happened in the states in cinemas and schools? No, not since the gun law change, which again, is exactly why we changed the law. So not a reach at all. Don't be involved in criminal activity in Australia and you're pretty much guaranteed not to be a victim of gun violence.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"Gun violence and deaths are real, they occur and they are something to take seriously, that being said I think its important to look at the actual data. For instance lets look at gun homicides in the US. I think we can all agree that when talking about gun homicide in the United States its important to keep in context the overall prevalence.

According to the CDC, In 2019, there were 39,707 firearm-related deaths in the United States. 11,912 of those deaths were actual homicides. The others were suicides or accidental discharges. So in a year, in a country with a population of 328 million, homicides via gun use affected 0.004% of the population.

To be clear, I am not dismissing death via suicide. Suicide and homicide are both incredibly tragic occurrences which should be treated very seriously, however for the purposes of analysis, are distinctly different and should often times not be aggregated for the purposes of discussion on how to resolve the problem of gun violence (there are always exceptions to the rule though).

A significant portion of gun homicide is location specific. In 2019, if you look at the 20 cities in the United states with the highest number of homicides via guns, they were responsible for 4,024 homicides or 34% of all homicides in the United States. The combined population of those 20 cities was 31,104,520 or 9% of the total population in 2019.

An additional example of how a deeper look into gun violence can show how centralized it truly can be, is in the case of New Jersey (2021).   ""New Jersey’s shooting statistics highlight a stark disparity in the way gun violence affects the people of the state, with five major cities enduring a significantly disproportionate share of the pain. Camden, Jersey City, Newark, Paterson and Trenton account for 10% of the state’s population but had 62% of New Jersey’s 1,412 fatal and nonfatal shooting victims in 2021.""

A common argument I have seen is that an increase in the number of guns results in an increase in the number of homicides via firearms. An interesting example of information that does not fit this claim are the states of Vermont, Idaho and Maine. Vermont has a gun ownership rate of %51, in that over half of the population reports having a gun in their home. Vermont also boasts the lowest homicide rate via firearm in the nation at effectively 0 per 100,000 (N=11). Idaho and Maine were the next lowest with rates of 1.7 and 1.8 respectively. Idaho reported 61% gun ownership and Maine reported 47% gun ownership. (2019). Compare this with the United Kingdom at 1.2 which is held as a gold standard in regards to a country with very low gun ownership and homicide rates.

So you have a situation where you can identify large distinctly different areas where gun ownership is incredibly high and yet the rate of homicide via guns is incredibly low.

This is also supported by a study focused on gun death rates in countries where gun ownership is incredibly low. Australia for example enacted the NFA (National Firearm's agreement) which involved the buyback and destruction of over 600,000 guns within a few months, and is one of the most massive government adjustments to gun control regulations in the developed world in recent history. However a 2010 study looking at gun homicide (and suicide rates) post the NFA found ""This paper takes a closer look at the effects of the NFA on gun deaths. Using a battery of structural break tests, there is little evidence to suggest that it had any significant effects on firearm homicides and suicides. In addition, there also does not appear to be any substitution effects—that reduced access to firearms may have led those bent on committing homicide or suicide to use alternative methods"".

Additionally if you take data from the ""Mental Health America"" website which quantifies mental health resources for each state and the level of income equality for each state you end up finding very high correlations with unlawful gun deaths much more so than gun ownership or types of gun laws present.

Estimates of defensive gun use vary depending on the questions asked, populations studied, timeframe, and other factors related to the design of studies. However the report ""Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence"" indicates a range of 65,000 to 2.5 million justified defensive gun uses each year. Although definitions of defensive gun use vary, it is generally defined as the use of a firearm to protect and defend one’s self, family, others, and/or property against crime or victimization.

So even at the lowest estimate there are 65,000 justified defensive uses of firearms when compared to 11,912 deaths which were ruled homicides. For every 1 homicide there are 6 justified defensive use of firearms.

The report also came to the conclusion: ""Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was ‘used’ by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies.""

To be clear the 65k defensive uses was determined via  the US Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics under President George H. W. Bush. They utilized a National Crime Victimization Survey and estimated that annual defensive gun uses occur about 65,000 times per year. The NCVS data relied on interviews of victims who reported violent crimes to the police.

Furthermore, according to the CDC “Self-defense can be an important crime deterrent,”. This was one of the findings of a $10 million study commissioned by President Barack Obama via 23 executive orders to look into gun violence.” 

Guns don't replace situational awareness, running away, and short range unarmed self defense like krav maga, they simply augment those strategies and provide another self defense option. In many situations guns are the only tool which can provide effective self defense, such as in a mass shooting.

I believe the news plays a critical role in trying to over-exaggerate the level of gun violence we have in the United states. I believe the reporting of gun homicides can be disingenuous in regards to reporting all of the facts and overall prevalence. For example if you look into gun homicides in 2020, most news articles will report (and focus on) a 32% increase in homicides from the previous year. While this is an absolutely true statistic, it also needs to be tempered with difference in prevalence from the previous year to give context to the scope. There were 19,384 homicides via gun in 2020 with a recorded population of 329.5 million. This means the prevalence of gun homicide in 2020 was 0.006% in the US. So, while the increase in gun homicides increased by 32% between the years 2019 and 2020, its very important to note the prevalence increased by 0.002%

Lastly the SCOTUS has ruled 4 times that the police do not owe a specific duty to provide police services to specific citizens. Your safety security and protection in the United States are 100% up to you. (Warren v. District of Columbia, Castle Rock v. Gonzales, Lozito v. New York City, DeShaney v. Winnebago County)",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"Thanks for the detailed response!! I've always been really surprised they don't require you to do a proper gun safety and proficiency course in the states. Hell, if you grew up shooting beer cans on your uncle's farm, maybe you could even have the option to test out of it. It would only be a few hours long, and would probably go a long way.

Based on this, your laws sound very reasonable as a model for our future legislation. It sounds like Canada doesn't infringe on the freedom of the people to own firearms, just makes sure people who buy guns are educated on how they work, and folks are at least asked why they need them.

In my mind, most Americans want guns less to defend themselves against wild animals, but more to level the playing field in case of crazy/unpredictable people who may also be armed. Admittedly, it's probably mostly psychological, but armed robberies and carjackings are really common here, not to mention vindictive exes showing up with guns and . Although I'll concede that lots of Americans do fetishize them in a really weird way, there are legitimate concerns.

I do have a couple concerns about licensing though. First, if someone's made a legitimate, specific threat to your life and the cops don't care; or if for whatever reason you're going to need to defend yourself *that same day,* red tape means that you would be unable to get one in time. I mean I personally would wanna leave town for a few days if that was the case for me, but not everyone has that option.

Second, if the (American) government has a list of everyone who owns a gun, (American) cops would probably be more aggressive with peaceful gun-owners if a gun-license shows up when a police officer runs someone's plates or goes to an address. Also, if you're a person living in one of our lovely ""semi-fascist"" states, the government could use this information to target political dissidents and use their documented firearm ownership to justify violence against them. Frankly, minorities in America don't have gun rights.

I realize that this turned into a bit of a rant, but would love to continue this discussion! No thank you on the moose hahaha but would love to have a Tennessee vs Canadian whiskey contest sometime haha",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"I grew up thinking this as well! 


But I must link to the amendment here, look:



If everyone has or may have a gun, then by the logic of ""guns are meant to kill people"" America would be relatively free of crime. Why? Because a criminal would have to fear that, upon using violence, every civilian within a 3 mile radius will draw their own firearm and gun them down mercilessly. 


But that is not at all what happens, so I conclude that the mindset of a criminal and an average civilian owning a weapon are very different: A criminal may wish to use it to kill, but the civilian probably just wants to feel safe. Like they could protect themselves.


So I actually understand where the wish for firearms is coming from, but I also have to ask: Shouldn't safety be sought in *not getting shot* rather than being able to shoot when you feel the need?",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,I'm not saying it's not edited but just look at the statistics of gun violence and: America nr 1 baby. Not even close.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Hi, yes, I did make a claim but I felt it was warranted by you saying limiting access to a Right. Generally anyone I’ve heard say that, has wanted guns to be banned so. Sorry. I didn’t even read your handle though, I know what fire watchers  are, but that had nothing to do with my claims. Onto your claims now: according to the resources a quick search popped up; handguns were used much more than a long gun, rifle and shotgun combined, in mass shootings (where they classify it as 4 or more shot/killed). So that already doesn’t make sense.  And I’m glad you own guns, very useful tools. I own one as well, and I love the freedom to choose to get more if I so chose without restriction. I haven’t done anything wrong in life, I’m not mentally ill, I’m not thinking on causing ill intent at all, but some proposed bills would want to limit the freedom of mine. You say you need these tools based on where you live, which I dont want to know where you live, but that would imply you think some areas in America aren’t deserving of that same freedom to choose. What other restrictions would you propose to try to limit access that doesn’t infringe on, just for this example, my rights, either to use the 2nd or right to privacy. After the recent Supreme Court case, New York tried to implement using a persons social media as grounds of determining whether someone should be allowed to have a license. The law isn’t subjective, it shouldn’t be subjective. It can’t be, otherwise one cop who is the approving authority might be having a bad day that day or might believe that no civilian should be able to own a gun. Just to keep this long ass thing short; criminals or people who intend to do harm will find a way to do harm. Gun or no guns. Great Britain has no access to guns outside clubs but yet still have some shootings, and primarily knife attacks. Violence will always find a way.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"&gt;I think there are 2 distinct American attitudes, one is how we externalize our anger, our ruggedness in a sense prepares us to “fight the enemy”. The way we try to solve problems is through violence and subjugation, the state criminalizes and punishes, people are taught to fight it out like men, and it goes beyond race, we glorify the strong fighter.

I think that as a global attitude, not an American one. Unfortunately, employing reason and rational thought only goes so far, especially if the person/s you're dealing with are unreasonable. It's what some young boys learn as early as the sandbox: there's nothing stopping a bully from taking from you, unless you risk a bloody nose and black eye in order to prevent that from happening.

&gt;The other American attitude is our attitudes toward guns and how they should be used as tools to solve our problems. It is that individualism that is strongest here but we have made gun ownership pervasive, guns are everywhere because of our belief that they can solve conflict.

I agree with this. Film and television really screwed us up, as the ""good guy with a gun"" is instilled in children at a young age from cartoons to live-action shows. Males in particular are taught a distorted caricature of masculinity, where if someone merely insults you, the response is to clock them in the jaw, and they'll fall to the ground instantly. And if something slightly more egregious happens, grabbing a gun and shooting people will bring ""justice."" 

If the ""good guys"" like Rambo, Arnold, the Punisher, etc are shooting shit up, that's not too different from O-Dogg, Lil Cyco, Baby Danger, Blueface, etc shooting shit up. Everyone sees themselves as the ""hero.""

That said, I think the criminal culture is overly romanticized in the U.S., and I think that's far more influential than gun culture here. I mean, American culture actually mainstreams musical performers who are self-admitted members of violent street gangs, who promote their real life criminal organizations in the music and video, and encourage violence in the community. That's absolutely insane. We wouldn't allow white supremacist musical performers to promote the KKK at the Superbowl Half Time Show or at the VMAs, but if its a musical performer promoting Bloods or Crips, and singing about the murder of fellow black men, that's A-OK. 

&gt;So how does this lead to 4 minors shooting guns, well that part is complicated, it relies on a lot of distinct American sub culture attitudes but make no mistake it is an American attitude.

Criminal culture is way more ubiquitous. We even have VH1 promoting violence and the mafia with reality shows like *Mob Wives*. YouTube regularly allows rappers with 80Million views to promote real life gangs, and gang violence, while flashing illegal guns on camera. The Superbowl had Snoop Dogg draped in a blue bandana, throwing gang signs, and yelling out ""CRIP!!"" while on stage performing, and Good Morning America was gushing about nostalgic the show was and how ""awesome"" ""Uncle Snoop"" was. Most  middle class squares listen to gang related rappers like Trippie Red, Blueface, Kodak Black, etc. We regularly support film and television shows that romanticize the mafia, Mexican cartels, biker gangs, or drug dealers, while portraying them as sympathetic anti-heroes and underdogs.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,"**Firearms regulations in New England** are primarily laid out by the Firearms Act 2037.

New England's gun laws are among the most restrictive in North America. All firearms must be registered with the Department of the Interior, and anyone purchasing or otherwise acquiring a firearm requires a licence; however, the difficulty of attaining this licence varies depending on the type of weapon.

**Firearms Act 2037**

The Firearms Act 2037 was enacted by the Parliament of New England in January 2037. It consolidated six earlier statutes and a number of regulatory orders into a single statutory framework, including amendments to the Criminal Code. Its enactment did not substantially change the existing gun laws, primarily the Firearms Act 2025, Firearms (Licencing) Amendment Act 2028, Misuse of Firearms Act 2030, Firearms Licencing Act 2032 and Criminal Code (Violent Crime) Amendment Act 2032. The regulatory framework under the Act is laid out by the Firearms (Commencement) Order 2037 and Firearms Regulations 2037, as modified by the Firearms Regulations (Amendment) Order 2040.

**Licencing requirements**

The Firearms Act makes it a crime to possess or use a firearm without a licence to do so, except for safety training in connection with the acquisition or maintenance of a firearms licence, target shooting at an approved range, or in connection with the manufacture and testing of weapons at an approved facility. 

The process of getting a firearms licence and the difficulties involved vary depending on the type of licence to be acquired. The gun licence grants permission for the possession and use of different types of firearms in different situations. To own a firearm in a specific category, one's licence must explicitly permit them to do so (e.g. a licence to own a Restricted firearm would not automatically confer the right to own a Category C firearm). Firearms in New England are divided into seven categories:

Category | Type
--------|----
A | Hunting rifles, shotguns
B | Antique guns (those produced before 1945)
C | Pistols
D | Semi-automatic rifles
E | Other long guns
Restricted | Sniper rifles, automatic assault rifles
Special Restricted | Rocket launchers, machine guns, and other defence-grade weapons

In general, ordinary citizens can only receive licences to own Category A, B, and C guns, Category D and E guns are expensive and time-consuming to acquire, requiring extensive training, Restricted guns are generally only available to security personnel and Special Restricted weapons are almost entirely banned except in connection with the Department of Defense. 

To make an application for a licence, an applicant must be a citizen or permanent resident of New England (i.e. possessing a national ID number and card), over the age of 16, and has not been convicted of certain crimes specified in the Firearms Regulations (including murder, armed robbery, domestic violence, etc.). Registered sex offenders also cannot possess a gun. Applications are filed with the Department of the Interior. There is an application fee of $75.

The Department of the Interior then forwards the details of the applicant to the Commonwealth Police, who conduct a background check including consulting with mental health services. This includes a mandatory inspection by police of the premises and the presentation of the place in which the applicant intends to store the gun. If the background check does not reveal any red flags and the police deem the security of the premises and storage arrangements adequate the application will be processed by the Department of the Interior.

Most licences to own Category A, B, and C weapons are shall-issue, meaning that if the applicant passes all other requirements, without a specific reason (such as a criminal conviction, active prosecution, history of domestic abuse, serious mental health issue, physical health issue making it unsafe to own a gun, etc.), the processing officer must issue the licence within 90 days of receiving the application from the police. However, the applicant must choose a type of licence for which they wish to apply. These are General, Hunting, Professional, Carrying, and Special. 

General and Hunting licences comprise over 80% of gun licences issued. These permit the ownership and storage of the gun in the licensee's home, subject to annual inspections by police of the storage conditions. Licensees are allowed to own up to 125 rounds or shells at a time on a General licence, but there is no restriction on a Hunting licence. The Hunting licence, however, cannot be granted to those living in an urban area. The Professional licence permits the carrying or use of a gun in connection with one's job, such as a security guard. It does not give the right to own a firearm, only that to use firearms provided by the employer. The Carrying and Special licences, meanwhile, are may-issue even for Category A, B and C guns. Carrying licences permit the carrying of guns in a vehicle or on public transportation when not going to or from a firearms-related activity. The Special licence covers any other situation not specified by the act. Licences for D, E, and Restricted guns are processed on a may-issue basis, and most applications are denied. These guns may only be applied for under a Professional or Special licence. Applications for Carrying, Professional and Special licences, as well as all applications for Restricted guns, include a mandatory interview with a police officer. 

The applicant must also attend an approved gun safety class. Currently, these must cover the safe storage, handling and use of firearms, the legal requirements related to possession and legitimate use, and first aid training. Proof of attending this class must be submitted within 30 days of the receipt of the licence or it will be revoked.

All licences last for five years except for Professional licences which last for the duration of employment at one employer. Licences are linked to one's national identity number and can be viewed by police. The licence is automatically revoked in case of a criminal conviction that would make one ineligible to receive a licence, or upon registration as a sex offender. Additionally, if a sex offender lives with a person licenced to own a firearm they must inform the police and the household will be subject to additional inspections.

**Gun registration**

All guns in New England must be registered. Owning, manufacturing, selling or knowingly using an unregistered gun is a criminal offence punishable by up to five years in prison. Every gun is issued a serial number by the Registrar of Firearms, the officer responsible for maintaining the Firearms Registry. The Registry is an up-to-date database of firearms and who owns them. Each firearm must be linked to a national identity number or to a registration number granted to gun shops and licenced dealers by the Registrar.

Guns that are sold or transferred must be re-registered within 14 days. Guns that enter the country from abroad must be registered as soon as practicable, and may be seized by the Registrar if the registering person is found not to possess an appropriate gun licence. 

**Other restrictions**

In general, it is illegal to carry any sort of weapon, including guns but also knives, pepper spray, electric shock devices, etc., in government buildings or to a demonstration or mass meeting, without a permit from the local police. This means in practice that only police may be armed at demonstrations.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then remind yourself that's also enough opioid prescriptions for every man woman and child to have a full prescription for a month. Think about that. Is it emotional trickery that America has a disproportionate amount of gun violence compared to any other first world country? Is it emotional trickery to realise that having more than 0 school shootings in a year let alone in a week is a fucking problem?

Same gun. Same performance. They ban the ""tactical"" one and ignore the one that looks like grandpa's varmint shooter.

And it's all a pretty pointless distraction. Democrats are betraying Progressives by focusing on guns, knowing full well significant reform will never pass, when every single dime, every single second of ad time, and every single piece of legislation submitted to Congress on the topic could be spent on calling the GOP's bluff about mass shootings being a mental health issue and demanding affordable access to mental healthcare for all Americans. After all, half of all gun deaths are suicides.

Every single time some racist on Fox News says, ""gun violence is really an inner-city thing, why should white people give up their guns?!"" Dems should say, ""Hey, why don't we do something about that? Let's pass this legislation to overhaul the infrastructure in our poor inner cities, build more schools, increase teacher pay to attract more to the area, fund some scholarships for inner city kids, and offer some subsidies or zero-interest loans to inner city businesses that aren't predatory so people can take ownership of their communities instead of live surrounded by people and companies looking to exploit them and keep them poor?""

The ""weapons of war!!"" fearmongering and the misguided legislation focused on ""tactical"" BS is wasting time and resources that could be spent helping people. Imo that's why Dems and the media love the gun control debate. They can hammer on it all day without ever having to actually deliver on it.

Republicans, too, actually. Both sides do tons of fundraising on guns. The GOP scared their base by claiming the Dems are coming to steal their guns.

As for the ratio, you are much more likely to be attuned to that than I am, it is something you're probably far more attuned to than I am.

The prison industry benefits from black on black violence to keep black people locked up and use them for forced labour and the real estates benefits from gun violence in inner cities black neighborhoods because then many renters sell their homes for a low price and move out from black neighborhoods and real estates buys it out for a low price and resell it or rent more expensive.

While politicians don’t give a damn about it.

27,"&gt; Why not just sell it to a local gun store for more money?

My aim is not profit but destruction of an object I can't easily destroy myself so what does this get me??

&gt; Also you need to define the purpose of a buyback to determine effectiveness

Thats fair because this could be a ""destroy a gun you don't want for free"" program as far as I'm concerned and I'd be using it. We can debate the effectiveness of increasing participation by subsidizing the energy/travel/etc thats a modest return in doing and determine if the tax money necessary is really a big waste in the scheme of things but if it gets guns out of hands that don't want them in other hands its doing its job in my book.

&gt;  If the purpose is to reduce guns in circulation, those guns that are being turned in are just as much in circulation as the ones on the shelves of gun stores. 

I've clearly stated I will only give to this if the guns are to be destroyed. If we buy guns back to recirculate them I 100% agree these programs have no point.

&gt; If the gun stores don’t stop selling them, then you haven’t reduced the number of guns in circulation, making the buyback a waste of money.
What? Let's say we have 2 guns in all of America today. Tomorrow I have 1 destroyed but you also go buy a new gun. We could have had 3 guns in circulation but we're back to 2. Purchases outpacing gun destruction may make all this a drop in the bucket but mathematically I'm not sure how a gun being destroyed isn't a net loss to circulation.

&gt; If the purpose is to reduce gun violence, you’re taking guns from people who otherwise wouldn’t have hurt anyone with those guns rather than the people who actually hurt people with those guns.

It's not that PL voters *can't* do anything about stopping, say, gun violence. School shootings are not an existential fact of life but can be fixed with commonsense gun safety policy.

A huge majority of crime in America comes from single parent household young men in cities. Additionally, single parent households have become far more frequent in the last few decades which (coincidentally?) also corresponds to the time frame in which mass shootings and other gun crimes have gotten worse while gun ownership and gun technology has been consistent far longer. Both Japan and Australia do not have a comparable, single parent household rate to the US not gun ownership rate.

'Assault Weapon' is a made up term that they can apply to any weapon that looks scary to them, and the nebulous definition can be changed at a moment's notice to further infringe upon rights. Further, if we want to look to the constitution and the second amendment, then we should look at its intention. I would say no matter how you interpret it, then weapons with parity to modern military weapons are exactly what it's talking about, otherwise there is no reason for it to exist.

This isn't coming from a right-winger either. You can look at any serious leftist author on the subject and they'll pretty much tell you the same thing.

Especially given that generally speaking, a ban like this, or the National Firearms Act all do the same thing. They make sure that effective weapons are only available to the rich, and those who already have them. Likewise, legislature like this only passes when the left begins to arm itself. Look at the Mulford Act for another example of this.

The above should be of GREAT concern to you as a leftist, because even if you don't believe in a socialist revolution, you should still have the understanding that the outcomes for calling law enforcement in low income areas and by PoCs are generally super bad. And yet these are EXACTLY the people we are denying effective weapons to. Further, in a time of increasing political violence and bigotry against LGBTQ people and their allies, you are also insisting that they were just too late to arm themselves against the deranged chuds out in the streets howling for their blood. Your position keeps guns in the chuds' hands and keeps them out of the hands of people who want to be defended, and not by a police force that takes an hour to do anything and might shoot you on sight for being the wrong color when they finally do respond.

44,"Largely the patriarchy, more specifically toxic masculinity, affects men and women in different ways, including mental illness and violence. It normalizes violence and pushes  men towards emotional repression and explosive outbursts as being appropriate. It's part of the reason men are more violent inherently in most cultures. Women are affected by this same system but in ways that are more objectifying and pushed towards subservience and emotional abuse as an unhealthy outlet and way of control as opposed to physical violence. 

Physiology plays some role. Male sex hormones are linked with more aggressive and violent behaviors in humans and most vertebrates. 

The fact that most shooters are men perpetuates this as well as copycat motives and inspiration play a large role in most mass shooter's mentality and planning. If you draw a diagram of mass killings in America based on how they were inspired, most branch back to Colimbine, which in turn can be traced to the Oklahoma City Bombing, which in turn can be traced to inspiration by the Waco Seige and Ruby's Ridge Standoff. Publicized radical violence begets publicized radical violence. 

Lastly the fetishization of gun culture among Americans has lead to a culture that makes them easily accessible and a part of both national and gender identity stereotypes.

We also seem to have a fundamental disagreement to what a “right” actually is. Guns are not a right, the constitution from 200 years ago is not 100% applicable to modern times and when they aren’t, they should be amended as society evolves. 
Rights should be applicable worldwide, not just in the American bubble-verse. 

So… if the constitution was gone tomorrow you still would have the right to guns? But isn’t the whole backbone to gun-rights is the outdated 2nd amendment? If that were gone, the American constitution would be very similar to other nations who to my knowledge had not explicitly had anything similar to “the right to keep and bear arms” in their constitutions.

So, if guns are a right, and not related to the constitution, why are they not a “right” in other nations? Other nations had gun violence and public-access to guns much like America, but they introduced restrictions/bans and gun-violence, homicides, death-rates, crime, mass shootings all went down by a significant % as a direct result.

And to pre-emptively answer “But those countries are nothing like the US”, well you are correct, because they fixed the root issues, while America let it grow worse, and worse, and worse, and now it’s 2022.

You ask people from these countries about American gun-rights and they ridicule America for these backwards views. 

I could easily rant about the examples you presented, but all I’ll say that it is more likely for the attacker to enact their “dangerous freedoms” with a “force multiplier” than it is for the defender, and the lower-class in society are a significantly affected by gun violence and related crimes. 

Adding a gun to the crazy BIL is like adding fuel to a fire. Surely you can see how the crazy ex BIL having “rights” to a gun makes the situation you described, force-multipliably worse, right? 

But lets face it, the argument for keeping “gun-rights” is the equivalent of a toddler throwing a tantrum because the gun-activist snowflakes can’t handle change for the betterment of society. Legit question, why is that? Is it because you feel like the gun gives you power or control over other humans? Is that what you mean by force-multiplier?",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time though, there are a lot of Canadians (myself included) who see this anti-American mentality as a fabricated superiority complex that distracts from our own issues. I mean, things aren't perfect up here either. It's cool that our Healthcare is free at the point of service, but quality of care can range from meh to utter dogshit depending on where in the country you are. Canada usually ranks pretty low among developed countries in terms of Healthcare quality, even though we treat public Healthcare as this huge point of pride. On gun violence, sure things are nowhere near as bad up here, but there's been a significant uptick recently despite strict gun control laws that are only getting stricter. And on other issues like cost of living, we're doing much, much worse.

Increasingly I hear more pushback from other young Canadians towards this ""America bad Canada good"" mentality typical of Canadian boomers, but that's kinda where majority opinion in this country lies.

Now sure, we can look at the video and be like mehhhhh everything was fine. All that was stolen was a phone. In the end it’s not so bad eh?  

Except in that moment, that woman had no idea if that guy had a gun (a very real possibility in America and across all sides of the aisle) or a knife, or was fucked up on drugs and was going to eat her face.  So yeah, basically everything about this interaction was threatening.

Maybe he has a good heart and his mom needs money for an operation. Either one wouldn’t surprise me in this country. 

NONE of that changes the fact that what he did was assault and robbery.  Any hypothetical details about home life, motives, etc. is completely irrelevant. At face value, what he did was super fucked up no matter how you slice it.

My general response is this: why is America the ONLY first world, great country where this happens constantly? I know it’s rare. I know that, statistically speaking, my wife and son will not be gunned down in an Applebees. The problem is that it’s *significantly* more likely to happen in America than in Ireland, Belgium, France, Canada, England, Holland, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Spain, Italy, etc. 

&gt;	By outlawing a type of gun that is mostly used by hobbyists and will cut down on the death toll by a couple hundred a year (assuming the monsters committing mass violence don’t switch to bombs, or handguns/shotguns/hunting rifles/poison instead)?

I don’t want to be combative, but you’re almost writing off hundreds of deaths. If banning one type of gun that no one NEEDS saves a thousand lives per year, sign me up. Your gun is not that important. 

We have a lot of excuses, but very few solutions. I’d like to offer solutions:

1) if you’re a hobbyist who wants a semi-auto rifle, you have to answer a few questions. We need you to explain why you NEED to shoot this many rounds as quickly, accurately, and efficiently as possible. 

2) if you’re on parole/probation, have know gang ties, and are caught with a handgun, you’re going to prison. 

3) three week waiting period on all gun purchases. You don’t NEED a gun now, and this would very likely cut down on suicides.

64,"People of the future will ask exactly the same questions about a lushly photographed advertisement for, say, Hennessy cognac. Of course it's psychoactive, we aren't ignorant about safety, we make informed decisions, aware that there are risks and rewards. Most of us, most of the time, enjoy moderate, responsible use. Addiction and damage occur, and they're treated as the medical issues that they are. We once experimented with prohibition but it only benefited violent criminal cartels, introduced toxic contaminants, corrupted law enforcement, created violence with machine gun attacks in the streets, and criminalized otherwise law-abiding citizens. 

The way you frame the question is an artifact of more than a century of propaganda. It's like when we first started visiting China, and the people there asked us how much the rice ration was in America. There was a time in American history when citizens had the right to take whatever the hell drugs they wanted. The drugs and dosages were quite definitely psychoactive. People knew about the dangers of addiction. Most users were moderate and responsible users, ordinary productive people. If they encountered problems, they got medical treatment, not criminal prosecution. It was correctly assumed that adult Americans had a right to privacy, as we would say now, which included making their own decisions about ingesting drugs. Drugs were reasonably priced, not prohibitively expensive, so you didn't have to steal car radios all day to afford them. No cartels, no overflowing prisons, no billionaires in Mexico and Colombia, no urban machine gun wars. 

The real problem was the lack of any regulation requiring listing of ingredients. Dr. Whizbang's Energizing Nerve Tonic could literally be anything. We made a tragic mistake when we headed down the dark and futile road of prohibition rather than requiring disclosure of ingredients.

There is a **stark** difference in general levels of education among people living in those portions of Africa and the people living here in the US. To say that they’re capable of the same cooperation, cohesion and planning as Americans is just not a fair comparison, and to compare the available equipment and weaponry that they have to ours is also grossly unbalanced. I’d also say that, having been there and experienced it my self, that the tribal roots present in both Africa and the Middle East are blatantly played upon by both governments and religious leaders such that the populace remains divided, and thus unable to work together at all.

Your argument that there are European countries with minimal gun ownership and a functioning society are stronger, but still up for interpretation. While I’m Afghanistan, I saw a small boy raped to death by his “father” (google Afghanistan’s dancing boys) and was expressly prohibited from stopping it.

The adult male did not use a gun in this horrific act of violence.

In Kenya I watched a man stab another man in the eye with a box cutter over a misunderstanding about supposedly stolen fruit. No gun here either.

In Romania I saw a women beaten in the street simply for being a gypsy. A Romanian man tried to intervene after *several minutes*, and he too was beaten.

In Japan I had to read an Intel report about an 8 year old girl who was raped and murdered, and left in her family’s mausoleum- while still alive- to die in agony. Again, no gun.

Perhaps these things happen less frequently in non gun-owning nations, but as someone who’s been shot, I’d much rather be shot again than have any of the above happen to me.

The fact that almost every single developed nation is horrified of what weve become is already telling enough to tell us that something is horribly wrong. But lets an example of this in play. The Supreme court is a hot discussion so lets talk about it. The Supreme Court was made with equality in mind, in no way should there be more right leaning justices than left, it should always be equal but now its 6-3 right to left. Another thing is workers pay and workers rights. I am currently working two jobs that both pay above the minimum wage and am living in a place that has rent below to national average, plus my mother works a full time job, we would literally be homeless if we didn't get government benefits from my dead dad, in fact i'm writing this while on my third double shift his week. And America is one of the only developed nations to not have any maternity leave or guaranteed paid vacation. But Take for example France which has at least 2 week paid maternity leave, but, who's minimum wage while already being higher than America's, also changes with inflation every year, why can't we do that. Also, workers pay has actually decreased in the last 30 years while CEO's have made on average 900% more than what they did thirty years ago while still being paid 327-1. And lets look at police for a second. police corruption has increased almost 40% within the last 25 years and are paid now more than ever. Police are supposed to serve and protect but now they let domestic terrorists into the capital and let other terrorist groups like the Proud boys basically terrorize racial and sexual minorities alike. And not to mention Healthcare, the one and only nation out of the 34 recognized developed nations to not only not have universal Healthcare, but we don't even have public transportation. Gun violence is so unbelievable rampant that we have had more mass shootings in the U.S. than days in the year. And regular crime is some of the highest in the world. And finally we have fascism. Women's rights being stripped, contraceptives being targeted and sexual minorities at stake, the land of the free is currently taking freedom away from their citizens. America is a democracy, not a theocracy, but more and more laws are being passed by far right religious extremists. Not everyone in the U.S. believes in Christianity, yet these laws are molded to fit Christian standards. In example of abortions, the Jrwish believe that life begins at birth, and the Bible says that life begins at first breath, this new ruling was never about protecting children, it was about controlling women.

If you need a barometer on what kind of person Falwell is, he said, and I quote, in regards to 9/11 — “*The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked. And when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad. I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularise America, I point the finger in their face and say, 'You helped this happen.’*” He retracted those comments later, saying that he was taken out of context… he wasn’t.

I do truly believe that someone like me, an areligious person who fights for human rights, treats others with dignity, advocates for the underprivileged, etc is more closely following Jesus’ teachings than most outspoken members of the Christian Right. There’s a reason why christofascist is quickly becoming a more common term, and you’re right in that it more closely resembles the emergence of Naziism far more than the humble and kind teachings of Jesus. I knew the Christian Right was disingenuous when I didn’t see right wing pastors decrying the culture of gun violence in America after Sandy Hook, when they were silent on the murders and bombings committed by antiabortion members of the “Army of God”, and last of all, exactly as you said, when they worshipped Trump but called Obama the antichrist. Obama’s not perfect, far from it, and I’ll criticise him just as readily, but Obama was literally a church regular, didn’t commit adultery, was generally accepting and kind (even if it took some time for certain issues), and at least *tried* to help people a few times rather than just going all in on corporate welfare.

I also don't believe that just because a large portion of the population could be armed, would be able to stop a shooter.

We have seen time and again, ""Trained"" professionals, fail to exercise their training in a real life threatening situation.

With that being said, I believe that I could be the ""good guy with a gun"" but in all reality I don't know how I will react until it happens. And if the navy has taught me anything is that repetitive training will do the trick most of the time. 

Most citizens don't have that training... the only thing I can say as a pro 2A, is at least they had a chance, you know the whole, ""need it and not use it"" type of thing.

That church was lucky to have a retired Sherriff who has had the training and experience to take out the threat. 

And then you have the Uvalde cowards, who had just recently been trained, who had a very large portion of the taxpayers money buying them equipment... who outnumbered the shooter and still failed, meanwhile you have parents without guns running in to save their children... or at least would have if the police had let them.

Either way, I think it's important to remember this conversation in the future. There are so many political talking points on both side of the aisle that are just that... reactionary points. They are not well, critically, or reasonably thought out points. They are reactive in that one side wants one thing and the other another. But they never compromise.

No idea about the scope of violence of what they purchased.  I asked if it was locked up, they said yes, and ammo stored completely separately. “Great…how is that gonna help if someone breaks in?” — the question was met with crickets. They have a teenager and middle schoolers in the home. 

That’s the type of “oh I need a gun!” logic that leads to guns being in the hands of people who have ZERO business holding a gun.

I said I have no desire to be victimized in such a way ever again; I am not opposed to gun ownership (I am also in favor of gun and ammo restrictions as well; I struggle with holding opposing viewpoints on the topic, I can’t reconcile them). I just think a vast majority of folks in America think “oh I’ll get a gun to be safe” and never consider a single thing in the video you posted. A gun IS the opportunity for violence of action. I personally think in the majority of cases it isn’t a good choice and instead leads to violence being perpetuated by/against the gun owner. Sometimes, like for OP, it might very well be the only choice though-and it is, like he says in the video, a choice that shouldn’t be made lightly.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

90,"So currently in America, there has been a push to bring racial issues more ""forward"", I guess, is a way to say it. It's been an elephant in the room that people would tiptoe around. But now with the rise of social media, everyone having an internet trail (past or current posts, that kinda thing) or a camera readily available a lot of these issues are coming to light. 

Racially motivated gun violence has been on the rise in America recently. There was also the Gabby Petito case, where yes, a woman went missing, later found murdered and it was a tragedy. However it completely took over the news cycle for weeks, taking away much needed spotlight from other missing women or men or children. It's brought up issues that when minorities go missing, they never get this kind of coverage in the media. 

There's also been this level of entitlement that certain groups openly display. Given Dr. Honda's own ethnicity and experiences with racism, this hits a nerve. It hits a nerve with all of us in the minority category 

I think his ""change"" has just come with time and the changing landscape of how issues are being talked about. This also happens with many other podcast (or entertainment) hosts in general. Tone changes over time and evolves with the current culture.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

92,"The Uvalde PD is why we can't rely on police to help us when a shooting is happening. First, it takes at least 15 minutes to actually get support against a shooter (15 minutes of unfettered killing of trapped, vulnerable people). Then half the time, cops are as self-serving as anyone else and won't actually put their lives at risk- their job description- to neutralize a shooter in time. Same shit as Parkland. The answer isn't just ""reduce access to the most efficient and powerful guns"". A Texan, with more lax gun laws, could drive 2 hrs out of state to CO, a less lax state on guns, and raze a public place fairly easily. Gun violence in America has over 10 variables that make it out of control. The national population is sprawling. Canada and Russia are the biggest in land size, but we have the largest amount of land that has a substantial population throughout. It's hard to crack down on gun violence when there isn't enough funding/officers to adequately cover such an expanse of land. And having a difference in individual states' approach to gun violence makes it inconsistently applied. NZ, for example, is more unified in government, making it easier to accomplish this goal.

 This isn't to  argue against gun control- untrained gun owners could accidentally shoot nearby people when targeting assailants, I get it. But gun control can't work in as simple a way here as the UK, France, Denmark, AU, CA, et al, because of a dispersed population over a huge amount of land, significant legal divisions among states, and a police force inadequate in size to meet such a demand.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nothing, absolutely nothing will quicken the process of the educated elite and the wealthy to leave this nation than for people to feel unsafe going about their normal lives. The main thing that threatens the safety of people just going about their lives right now is gun violence. So, we can discuss policy and politics until our fingertips bleed meanwhile individual Americans are slowly siphoning their wealth offshore by uprooting their lives to safer areas of the world and companies will follow. Pretty soon the US is going to be like Nigeria.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oh so only gun violence matters, fuck everything else, got it.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"&gt;More guns definitely equals more gun crime, including murder.

So then this should be true for all countries, correct?  Because if the US alone is special that would clearly point to some other underlying issue.  So lets take a look:

The countries after America in gun ownership are Falkland Islands, Yemen, New Caledonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Uruguay, Canada, Cyprus, Finland.  

Now, first off we can take a look at your claim of more guns = more gun crime, specifically calling out murder, so lets take a look at the top 10 for highest rates of violent gun death per 100k residents:

El Salvador — 36.78, Venezuela — 33.27, Guatemala — 29.06, Colombia — 26.36, Brazil — 21.93, Bahamas — 21.52, Honduras — 20.15, U.S. Virgin Islands — 19.40, Puerto Rico — 18.14, Mexico — 16.41

We can also look as mass shooting deaths per 1M, which interestingly enough the US doesn't actually lead.  That would be Norway, which isn't even on our list.  Serbia does take second place, and Finland takes 8th.  The rest of the top places aren't even in our top ten.  Granted, this is some old data so it might not be the best thing to look at

We can look at quantity of mass shootings, but again outside of the US the numbers don't really line up.  France is the second most common place for mass shootings, which again isn't on out list.  Germany follows, also not on our list.  Canada and Finland do make an appearance, but beyond that none of our other gun loving countries make the top 20

&gt;If everyone carried swaords why wouldn't you expect sword crime to go up?

This is an example of what I mean when I say you are treating a symptom without  actually effecting the cause.  Because my answer is that yes, I would expect it to go up, *but only in cases where a crime would have been committed anyway*.  So yeah, a guy who was going to stab a guy with a knife now is stabbing them with a sword.  A guy who was going to hold up a store with a gun now maybe has a cutlass.  But, if you remove those swords, is that better?  A guy still got stabbed to death with a knife, it just wasn't a sword.  A store was still held up, just not with a sword.  In the context of the guns this is still a pro, because at least less people will die in the context of mass violence.  But you aren't stopping the mass violence, your just mitigating it when it happens.  Which is good, but shouldn't we actually fix the issue rather than pretending it's fixed because you just mitigated the losses?  Shouldn't we strive to fix the underlying problem as well?

&gt;And of course every other country has mental health issues. But why not tackle both guns AND mental health issues?

Thats literally what I suggested in the first post of mine you replied to.  Pretending guns alone are the problem is foolish, we need to tackle ALL the issues.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"Don't think you know what gaslighting is, and my statement wasn't meant to be a dig at the op. I think it's a truism that if the op chooses a gun over the GF, he loves the gun more than her. I'm not judging that choice or saying that's bad. I'm saying move on and find someone who doesn't have an issue with owning a gun.

Gaslighting is when you try to get someone to deny his own reality. Manipulation is the act of using psychology and other tools to get someone to do something (or not do something). Not wanting a gun in a house is a perfectly rational boundary in America right now. It's a leading cause of death in many demographics, and gun violence is getting worse.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"Being in the majority does not make one correct. I'm not here for a hate-fueled argument or more division. You're probably a good person who doesn't want to see these tragedies happen, just like every other sane person who likes their rights that you disagree with. 

Proof that it's not the gun's fault: 

Large numbers of high schoolers across the nation used to bring their guns to school to be ready to go hunting or attend rifle/shotgun team practice after class just a few decades ago. School shootings were virtually unheard of before the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, with Columbine being the most notable (4/20, 1989). 

The creation of metaphorical fish-barrels where we have a heavy concentration of unarmed victims-to-be, paired with a massive decline in mental health and the value placed on human life are the main factors that have allowed this trend of senseless violence to continue. 

Our rights are not up for negotiation, and it has nothing to do with the Constitution. They've been trampled on enough and it clearly hasn't solved anything.

Immediate solutions:

\- No more ""gun free"" zones. They're never really gun-free, they're just defense-free. The bastards that commit these atrocities don't care about a fucking sign.

\- Teach gun safety as part of health curriculums in middle/high school. America has firearms built into it's culture, but not it's health curriculums. I find that silly. This would prevent many accidents, but not necessarily solve the mass shooting problem. 

\- Stop making the mass shooters famous. We've actually been doing a decent job of this recently, but it could be better. When the mainstream news was flexing pictures of shooters along with their body counts, it gives those gremlins the infamy they wanted. 

Long Term Solutions:

\- Fix our culture in general: We're collectively more fucked up in the head than we've ever been. Personal responsibility, a sense of community, and general care for the fellow neighbor has decreased drastically over the years. That's not a situation that's conducive to a healthy, peaceful society. 

This change is much, much easier said than done, and it really starts with the person in the mirror. Past that, having more fathers stick around their homes and raise their children would be a great start, along with bringing back a culture that celebrates strong, responsible, caring men. Being a macho type who picks bar fights is not masculine. Having something beautiful like a family to protect, and living a peaceful life while maintaining a capacity for extreme violence is. 

Again, I do not take issue with you, just your ideas. I understand your motivations and why you feel the way that you do. If you lived near me, I would invite you to come out to the range with me and learn what this is really all about.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"Your original comment focused on the price, not availability. That was a failure of communication. 

The technology available at the time the 2nd was written included caseless machine guns and flintlocks which could fire “between 8 and 16 volleys at a time”. The founding fathers almost equipped the continental army with such firearms. It’s ahistorical to imply that semi-auto firearms were either unforeseen or not anticipated to be common place like muskets and breech loading rifles were at the time. 

We have taken positive steps to reducing the availability of firearms to those mentally incapable of handling the responsibility. This requires due process. If you’d like to skip due process, you need to justify why you’re removing due process from all 350,000,000 people in the country, not just what YOU decide is “insane”. 

Your bad faith, unsupported turnaround on allowing poor people to defend themselves is in contrary to your previous statement, as all modern gun control is either classist or racist. Historically, gun control in the US was based on trying to disarm black people. 

If you’re really interested in reducing mass shootings, the solution is not gun control. We have the gun control on the books that would prevent mass shootings while also respecting the right of the people to keep and bear arms. The solution to mass shootings is increasing the strength of communities. It’s increasing the strength of healthcare and public transportation. 

Its time for the government to provide instead of restrict. Focus on that. You’re not going to solve the violent culture problem in America without first addressing the causes of violence. The causes of violence are not guns existing, nor is it the availability to the average person. 99.9% of people who own guns don’t do anything like that. Rifles of all kinds aren’t even the #1 choice for mass shooters, it’s handguns. 

There’s no part of your comment that’s a legitimate argument here, yet you’re still acting like I’m the absurd one about caring for the underprivileged.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;At the same time you grasp desperately to “telescoping stocks, pistol grips, bayonet mounts, and flash hiders”. 

Sorry, that's the definition of an assault weapon per the '94 assault weapon ban and the CA assault weapon ban.

Combat trained marine here, scored expert every year on the range, have shot burst fire on the m16a4, fired an m4a1, m240b, m249, at4, tossed grenades, m203, all the basic stuff. I've done extra firing courses as well with nightvision and lasers and all the training and tactics that come with that.

It was reiterated continuously that burst fire isn't effective and that slow (semi auto) shots with good sight picture and trigger pull were the most effective methods of shooting.

The countries with the happiest populations do not have the Republican Party, ""the most dangerous organization in human history"". BBC [video interview](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-39879374 ""https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-39879374"") with Noam Chomsky, 11 May 2017.     
           
The happiest countries in the world do not have the deadly and poisoned NRA.  
            
The happiest countries in the world do not have the deadly Second Amendment, which has become twisted and perverted under the corrupted and dangerous Republican Party and the corrupted and dangerous National Rifle Association. Both cultivate death and gun violence and are active threats against human life, democracy, and the United States.    
            
The happiest countries in the world do not have nearly half of the nearly 1 billion guns held in civilian hands worldwide.  The US has up to an estimated 464 million guns held in civilian hands in June 2022, amounting to nearly one-half billion, projected to surpass 500 million sometime in the coming months, and surpass the one billion mark sometime in the years.   
          
The happiest countries in the world have not racked up more than 1.6 million children and adults shot dead on their national soil over the past 54 years, like the more than 1.6 million children and adults shot dead on U.S. soil over the past 54 years, from January 1, 1968 to June 11, 2022.

105,"Canada is pretty nice this time of year.

I know Americans like to kind-of-sort-of complain that we’ll move to Canada if things in America continue to get worse, but. Even among the Conservative Party of Canada, reproductive rights are considered a settled issue. You’d be hard pressed, at least from my interpretation, to find a Canadian politician hell-bent on challenging the pro-choice stance of the government. 

Then there’s the issue of gun control. I’m not sure exactly how many school shootings Canada has seen in the past 20 years, but I believe it’s below 10. Please correct me if I’m wrong. 

“One Canadian killed by gun violence is one too many,” Trudeau recently Tweeted. And he’s actually doing something to back up those words. In America the political right erupts in self-righteous, disingenuous outrage if someone brings up restricting gun laws in the wake of yet another school shooting. But yes, let’s keep jerking our dicks about how exemplary America is and, as Ted Cruz called it in the few days following the Uvalde shooting, “the safest country on Earth.” What a great guy. Clearly, he, and others like him who wield enormous political influence, have prioritized their re-election campaign platforms and financial donors over the welfare of their own constituents and fellow human beings. But I digress. 

Canada isn’t perfect, but the bottom line is their government seems to actually act like it gives a damn about their own citizens’ welfare, at least in these regards. Sorry for the rant and Canadians, please feel free to comment! Full disclosure, I am an American.


Also, a link about why the premise of “Breaking Bad” wouldn’t happen in the Great White North. 
[Why Breaking Bad Would Never Happen In Canada (COMIC)](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/breaking-bad-canada-comic-health_n_3984793)",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,"Yes, that sounds crazy! But you also have to take into account that the sources for those statistics (law, media and academic papers/ research) can’t agree on the definition of a mass shooting. According to the gun violence archives they’ve logged 213 mass shootings so far this year by there definition. However, the FBI has 187 mass shootings since 1966. Only 9 of the Gun Violence Archives logged shootings this year meet the FBI’s criteria of a mass shooting and 7 of those were domestic or gang violence. 
 I know people like to believe the US leads the world in mass shootings. The truth is we don’t. 
  What often gets left out is the US has the third highest population in the world. In 2016, the Crime Research Prevention Center found that when adjusted for population, the US actually ranked 12th in mass shootings per capita from 2009 to 2015.
 Two years later, it analyzed data on mass shootings across the globe from 1966 to 2012 and found that while the US made up roughly 4.6% of the world’s population, it accounted for less than 1.43% of mass shooters and 2.11% of the people killed in mass shooting incidents.
 Even though the media and politicians would have you believe otherwise, the US is hardly the worst country in the world when it comes to gun violence. The reality is out of 193 recognized UN countries, the US ranks 83rd per capita in gun violence at 5.3 murders per 100,000. Below the World average of 7.03 per 100,000. 
 Using the Washington post’s statistics, who also reported that 77% of all mass shooters obtained their guns through legal means, also reported that between 1966 and May 12, 2021 they logged  189 mass shootings, killing 1,322 people. On average, that’s 24 people killed per year with 145.53 legally obtained guns involved in mass shootings out of an estimated 400 million guns throughout the US. That’s what, 3.63825E-5%? 
 Since 1981, the United States has averaged 12,900 gun homicides per year.  This means that an infinitesimal 0.18% of all gun homicides were committed during a mass shooting.  Even the Gun Violence Archive, which has the most liberal definition of “mass shooting,” recorded 513 deaths in mass shooting incidents out of 19,395 total gun homicides in 2020—just 2.6%.
 Gun related homicides are far exceeded by gun related suicides as the primary cause of gun deaths in America. Every year since 1981, suicides have outpaced homicides, often by a wide margin.  In fact, as a percentage of all deaths, gun homicides are incredibly rare in the United States, accounting for just 0.41% of all deaths over the past 25 years.
 As far as “more guns equal more gun deaths.”That’s not necessarily true. 
 California has some of, if not the strictest gun laws in the US and is only one of a few states to receive a an A rating from the Gifford’s Center (an anti-gun advocate). California has also had 32 of the 187 mass shootings since 1966. That’s 17% and far more than any other state. 
 The idea is that stricter gun laws= less guns on the streets, which = less people killed by guns. But that theory is fundamentally incorrect. Gun homicides peaked in the late 80’s - early 90’s and have been declining since then, with the exception of 2014 and 2020. 
 In 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that there were roughly nine gun murders for every 100,000 Americans.  In 2013, that number declined by 40% to 3.6 per 100,000.  At the same time, private gun ownership skyrocketed by an estimated 56%–from 0.93 guns per person in 1993 to 1.45 20 years later.
 Since 2013 mass murders have increased even though states have implemented stricter gun laws. 50 yrs Prior to the Texas  Bell shooting of 1966, gun laws weren’t nearly as strict and there were 25 mass shootings. There’s been 189 in the 55 yrs that’s followed. States and the federal government alike have implemented tougher and tougher gun laws, yet more and more mass shootings keep happening.  Why?",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,"I'm sorry but this is not an equivalence imo. Addressing mass shootings and gun violence with restrictions meant to keep people safer, victims and offenders both, is very different from increasing the restrictions to the most basic right an individual can have in America, to vote for the people that govern them. And the proponents of ID to vote have never come up with good reasons in my own experience for it's necessity other than overstated 2020 election examples. If you have a good reason, shoot for it, but otherwise it just seemingly is an attempt to manipulate votes so they come out more favorable to a particular side in future elections, which is not a good reason.

A few pump action shotguns and revolvers here and there, but gun violence and particularly mass shootings are almost always carried out with a semi automatic weapon.  

You are trying to deflect by muddying the definition of a “assault weapon” because you don’t think a handgun falls under that category.  My opinion is handguns should have the same restrictions (or more) than your AR15s, SCARs and AK47s.  The problem is automatic loading rifles and handguns that are capable of holding lots of ammo and reload quickly and easily with preloaded magazines.

I obviously am concerned with reducing killings, it is disingenuous to suggest otherwise. I think, and there is evidence decreasing the amount of guns and making access to them much more limited and secured would do that.  

But you keep bringing up things to shift the specifics of what I am saying to burn the strawman you have. You keep talking about hand guns and rifles as if I am saying AR-15's or ""assault"" rifles are more of the issue. I have not said that once in this thread. I am not looking to demonize one form of firearm over another. The US has too many of all guns. Is the US an outlier on people getting beaten to death barehanded?

High profile school shootings like what lead to this are not gang violence, and they statistically happen in the US much more frequently than in other countries. This is an abhorrent situation, and it is something that I find personally intolerable. 

Don't you? Don't you find kids getting shot abhorrent whether it is a madman, or gang violence, or domestic violence? Don't you want less children to get shot?

Of course you do. You are not a monster. But you like your guns. I get that. But maybe just maybe, they are part if the problem. 

Do you genuinely think access to guns has no bearing upon the gang violence, or mass shootings, or school shootings? The US has 40% of civilian owned guns in the world. Do you not see how that might be tied to the higher amount of shootings and gun deaths?

This is not a theory I came up with, it is a commonly studied and discussed across the world. Most be come to the same conclusion. number and access to guns is why America has this issue.

Your questions at the end are so vague and without specifics I cannot really answer them.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

119,"Gonna be honest -- We have good laws in place. Its just shitty execution that's holding us back. 

Theoretically a person with a mental disorder, history of violence, or other limiting factors should not be able to get a gun but then the NICS has huge gaping holes in their records and people get approved when they should not. 

its not even the nics's fault, each law enforcement agency, IPD, LAPD, etc should be reporting all of that but they just don't. there's no accountability for the inside. 

The NICS being in place means that people can raise concern about mental health or malicious intent and if it passes and makes it onto the person's record they can be barred for life from having firearms or at least a heavy probation. (depending on state laws) 

Further there are states with gun license laws meaning that no one by default can get guns, one would have to go through a course spanning a few weeks to a few months with requirement for retraining, and that is to basically catch those who would like to use a gun for malicious purposes etc. And teach proper safety for those negligent injuries.

I hate it when people are like :oh what's with america and their lax view on guns, no we'd be pretty much near canada if all the laws we passed worked as intended. Its not america and their guns; its america being f\*cking addicted to political expediency and convenient truths. (and blind to what progress that has happened in the face of it)

That doesn't make sense.

The question is ""what is the role of ready firearm access in our absurd levels of gun violence?""

All available data indicates it's a HUGE factor, and is most likely the defining factor. 

The presence or absence of gun-ownership language in a document written 240+ years ago by people who thought owning slaves was fine is entirely irrelevant

The correlation between gun ownership and gun violence is actually quite weak, there are other variables (such as poverty), that correlate more strongly, and then outlier countries like Switzerland have comparatively high gun death/ownership rates.

128,"I mean, I’m going to preface this with the fact that you are likely right, because it is likely impossible to institute *enough* gun control in america, given there are more guns than people, to get to a state like what I’m going to discuss. But, hypothetically, my points should stand.

Well, first off, gun crime is an easy one to tackle.

I think it’s fairly safe to compare the US to other similar, western, english speaking countries in this. And, well, the US has more gun homicides per 100,000 people than all of the countries in question here combined.

I find it hard to dispute that ‘getting rid of guns prevents people shooting eachother’, when in places like the UK, gun homicides basically do not happen - while the US has *over ten thousand homicides with firearms* every year. And only six times the UK’s population.

As is, you are SIX TIMES more likely to be murdered as a US resident than as a UK resident. I, personally at least, do not think there is enough of a cultural difference there to explain a sixfold increase in murder rate purely from culture - something else has to play a part too.

I will admit, the US clearly has an increased amount of just general violence, as you also have more knife homicides per 100,000 people than the UK, but by a reasonably small margin.

I’ll also add, stabbings are often far less fatal than shootings, and shooting someone is both easier to do accidentally, and is far more removed from the actual victim in question. You have to actually get within arm’s reach of someone to stab them (where they may well fight back), whereas with a gun you can shoot someone from a very long distance away, and not have to confront your own actions.

In other words, I think the prevalence of guns significantly contributes to violence in the US, but I also don’t see a way to extricate those guns from your society, especially with the people that would definitely just shoot someone trying to take their guns away.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
129,"I would simply point to other countries around the world and the example they can give. A lot of western european countries have similar political cultures and many of the same issues around far right radicalisation (4chan etc...) and yet no other comparable country on earth has the same problems around gun violence as America. Some other countries such as Australia even started to have similar problems such as it's 1996 mass shooting and the government pretty much eliminated these problems by implementing a mass buyback of guns and much stricter controls on who can buy guns.

To be honest I live in the UK and find it completely maddening that most americans can't look outside your own country and see that this is a problem we have all solved.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

140,"Guns aren't as easy to create as drugs? Perhaps true at one point but certainly not anymore. 



Guns are very easy to disassemble and smuggle. Also easy to purchase on the black market even internationally especially in a place as large as the US which shares a border with Mexico. 


 With 3d printing and machining it's totally conceivable that individuals and criminal organizations can manufacture their own guns. It's already happening. 

Here's proof: https://youtu.be/Bs_y9V18p8o

Sorry to say but just like with drugs, alcohol, etc. The cats already out of the bag. You can't control it and your naive to think that by restricting enthusiasts and law abiding people you'd do anything at all to stop it. 


Your strawmanning when talking about allowing explosives and so on. Because at no point did I say reasonable restrictions on who is allowed to own weapons were wrong. I specifically stated the opposite in fact. Also with a bit of paperwork and some money you can literally own explosives, actual machine guns, and tanks. Always have been able to. And it's fine. 


The point was that we already allow plenty of things that harm us. Some like alcohol are very directly harmful while others like cars kill loads of people by accident. In either case, we make the decision that allowing people to use these in all their various forms is a freedom that we will allow even if eliminating them would save lives. Because freedom comes with responsibility and costs. And always has. 



Your argument boils down in many ways to ""all these bans on things I like won't work but on the thing I don't like they will work"" and it's logically inconsistent. 



Europe doesn't have a long history of gun ownership, nations the size of a continent covered in wilderness to the same extent as america, and are all culturally homogenous living mostly in cities. They also have lower overall violence period and far less drug trafficking and violence related issues. They don't share a massive land border with a nation run by cartels. Those are just a few of the MANY differences culturally, politically, economically, and geographically that make comparisons to Europe, Australia, etc. Irrelevant. And I can find you loads of example from all over south America of gun bans not only not working but making the problem worse. 



You are not my enemy. You are a good person who wants to reduce violence. But we can do that together and without draconian bans on something millions of Americans use peacefully. Bans don't work, especially in America. And never really have.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
141,"&gt;Now, I understand this might be hard to implement in america, but how do you rationalized the amount of deaths by gun violence in countries with gun control VS countries without?

because almost every static brought up in support of it shows a first world country where many other social issues have been solve, that happen to have strict gun control.   and the US has not fixed these social issues and it should be the real priority not trying to make the cvitizens defenseless.   a great US example is Puerto Rico where the murder rate by guns was 5x times the US average, and they had a near complete ban on firearm ownership.

142,"Physically removing them or preventing people from buying them is a distinction without a difference. Both situations would prevent legal gun owners from owning a firearm.

143,"As I am Australian, I can't really say much about the climate that's causing Mass Shootings in America and perhaps other countries, but I can say what my country did to stop it.

Our government at the time of the Port Arthur massacre, (A mass shooting in Tasmania in 1996, killing 35 people and wounding 23) put recommendations forth for specific gun laws, with the latest massacre evoking a *lot* of public concern. In a poll of 2058 Australians taken from the 3rd to the 5th May of 1996, 90 per cent of those surveyed supported a national ban on all automatic and semi-automatic firearms, 88 per cent supported firearms registration, 73 per cent thought that gun owners should pay an annual registration fee for each gun they own, and 69 per cent thought that gun owners should be required to store their guns at an armoury or with the police.

Over here, the right to private gun ownership is not guaranteed by law. You have to have a license to own a gun, and to obtain a license you need to have a genuine reason to own one, such as pest control, hunting or very *very* narrow occupational uses. *Personal Protection is not a valid reason.* [You have to have a genuine reason to own that particular type of gun.](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/2581) They do check that you are truthful about your reasons. They can and will run background checks. They take into consideration your criminal and personal history. [Have a history of violence? You won't get a gun.](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/2584) *The law stipulates that those with a past history or apprehended likelihood for domestic violence will be either revoked or denied.* [Have mental health issues? Depending on what it is, you probably won't get one](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/2881). If it's just anxiety, they likely won't care. However if you are a diagnosed sociopath, or something similar, they definitely will. 

Additionally, in some jurisdictions you need a third party character reference. They need someone you're not close to so they get an honest reference. Only licensed gun owners are allowed to possess, transfer or acquire ammunition or a firearm. A person permitted to possess ammunition only for those firearms for which the purchaser is licensed, with a limit on the quantity of ammunition that may be purchased in a given period. [You need to complete an accredited safety course.](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/2585) 

There is a 28 day waiting period before you receive a license. It is there for a reason. A large amount of acts of violence were recorded as not being premeditated. This at least gives time for checks and for them to hopefully cool off. [There's regulation on who can and can't buy ammunition, too.](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/2665)

[You even need a separate permit for each gun.](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/2583)

In fact, [here are the basic license requirements.](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/976)

Lastly, there was something called the ""National Firearms Buyback Program"". It ran from October 1996 through September 1997, collecting 650,000 guns. All of these guns were destroyed. Basically, each gun owner would be compensated for handing in their guns. A win-win situation, as they got compensated for giving something in that they'd eventually have to get rid of anyways. It was a mandatory buy back.

Change is painful, it always is.  The issue though is if \*we\* don't change quality enough, at least in regards to climate change, then nature will change us on its own whims.  Humanity will be worse off, and there will be a lot of unnecessary suffering and death.  

Hell, climate change could lead to resource wars which could lead to us just being stuck because we just don't have the resources to build the technology.  Or maybe our numbers have been reduced so much that we don't have the collective brainpower/manpower to get to the tech level that will elevate us.  

\&gt; but i don’t think it’s practical to demand that combustion cars stop being sold in the next 5-10 years

I disagree and I think it is just an issue of political will.  Going back to the issue of climate change, I do think it is hopeless.  I'm almost 40 now.  I grew up with Earth day and trying to be aware and care for our planet.  I was 20 when I was in college, and I saw a book published in 1900, written in the 1850s or something.  Even back then they were talking about how nature was changing due to industrialization and how humanity had to be careful.

It is now a full 120 years later, and honestly, we haven't really done shit.  We just don't have the political will.  Humanity needs to have their only house burn down before we realize we should take care of it.  We're just that fucking short sighted, collectively speaking.  

I mean, even with all of the minimal interventions we're doing, our future temperature levels will for sure change the weather in ways humanity has never seen before.  It'll be the status quo though, since that will be the only things kids know.  Oh, that and it'll be profitable.  Its normal for California to be on fire, or for them to be facing drought.  It'll be normal to have extreme weather, I mean, it is getting normal right now.  

As far as the gun control narrative of ""one step = total banning/eventually total banning"" is just a political way of drumming up more donations, in my opinion.  Culturally speaking, I don't think we'll ever get rid of guns no matter what we do, here in America.  I mean, I don't think it is even appropriate since there are many legitimate uses for guns.

But you may not know that other countries just don't have the same issues with gun violence as we have.  They don't have school shootings.  Mass shootings and school shootings are the norm in America.  Sometimes they don't even make the front page anymore.  Humans are supposed to care about children, but after Sandy Hook I know that if we couldn't even do a \*tiny\* thing to try to protect kids, then why would we try to make any significant change that might protect people at large?  

I definitely agree with you that being in the middle sucks.  Nuance is hard for brains, I guess.  Painting everything in just black or white makes it so much easier for our brains to deal, but imo it is fucking lazy.  But you know what?  If something is worth doing, we do it not because it is easy, but because it is hard.  Suffice it to say though that I do think it is pretty hopeless for humanity.

Cities like Chicago in the state of Illinois have some of the strictest ""gun control"" laws in our country. They are also the most violent, dangerous areas. 

Gun control doesn't stop criminals from owning guns. It stops law abiding citizens from defending themselves in appropriate means. 

In America, we don't have a ""gun problem"" as many claim we do. Guns have always been a part of our culture. Instead, we have a ""culture problem"" which glorifies violence through music, movies, video games, various forms of media, etc. 

&gt; Since putting laws in place, which one of which was to not except “personal protection” as a valid reason to own a gun, our gun crime rate has dropped

Not trying to be a grammar nazi, but did you mean ""accept""? 

I'm curious, how do more people own guns than ever before but cannot do so in the name of ""personal protection""? Did everyone in Australia all of a sudden take up hunting as a hobby? 

Lastly, you can trust your government all you want when it comes to the issue of guns. That's up to you and your countrymen. Me, personally, I'll enjoy my 2A freedoms and own one for whatever reason I want. Because I'm still convinced the only reason America didn't turn into Australia or Canada during COVID (intensity of lockdowns etc) is that the American people carried with them the ability to enact uncivil disobedience.

Liking posts, tweeting, or texting is not the same as face-to-face interaction. You're not going to learn facial cues, other body language, voice inflection, how to say things, or how to engage in repartee by tweeting. There are many people with social anxiety disorders who are good at tweeting, but will crumble in a face-to-face interaction. That's because there's a difference between social media and face-to-face interaction.

\&gt; Maybe they were on those meds because if they were mentally unstable enough to shoot their classmates

If that's the case, then the medication didn't work. By the way, Adderall isn't used for preventing people from shooting up classmates. It's used to help people focus. But have you ever read the side effects of Adderall? You should look into it. You should into the side effects for Prozac and Wellbutrin as well. It may be the case that these medications helped lead these kids to shooting up their classmates.

\&gt;There's not much evidence to support this claim, though. There's some evidence to suggest that violent media can prime people for aggression or violence in the short term

That's a bit of a contradiction, then, isn't it? How long do school shootings take?

\&gt;Sure, but it's odd how you can say that more children being born out of wedlock now might be a contributing factor

As I stated before, children who are raised by one parent or children who need to suffer through a divorce are less likely to succeed in life. They're more likely to be emotionally destabilized.

\&gt;but ignore the fact that there are currently more guns in America than there ever have been.

When did I ignore that?

Let me repeat what I ended my original post with: 

One last point. Banning ideas or things is to erode freedom. True, banning all guns would have an effect on school shootings, just like banning all cars would have an effect on car accidents and vehicular homicide. Instead of focusing on the tools and methods that people use to commit atrocities, we should be focusing on making people better. That way, we can keep our freedoms while reducing all violence, not just gun violence.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
156,"I know it's a very American thing where ""what happens in America = the world"", but the rest of the world mostly doesn't share the same level of gun violence. You could perhaps say that gun violence has changed society in America more than 9/11 and I'd agree that it's definitely worthy of a conversation.

When I was there I was constantly ogled over for being American. I was asked nonstop to speak on Trump, Obama, the War in Iraq, COVID situation in America, gun violence and now probably roe v wade. Maybe I look such, but I was also seen as “exotic” which got annoying quickly. (Not white)

Dating was hard because while I have never had trouble in that department, I was always seen an an outsider who would likely leave and go back. (Had I met someone serious I would’ve made arrangements to stay)

I can do an Aussie accent pretty really well and sometimes would fake one in situations where I wanted to avoid being identified as American. Sometimes I just wanted to go about my day without the questions

Having dual citizenship makes a lot of things easier. But as I stated in another comment, jobs are still harder because often they would rather hire someone born there unless you have exceptional work experience or a fancy degree from your home country. 

Lastly; Australia is not free from conservative mindsets, close mindedness or anything else really. Minus the gun safety there were times where politically and culturally I didn’t know whether I was in the US south or Australia.

I guess I should also ask, do you think it's worth it to reduce gun violence? If so, what do you think would work?

168,"We don’t get police shootings here, but we do get every male MET officer turning out to be some kind of sexual predator. 

Look at what happened with Sarah Everard - a member of the MET police force whose workmates called him “The Rapist” with a past of public indecency violently murders a woman, and when the public has a vigil to honour her, the MET then proceed to show up and violently arrest a bunch of women’s rights activists for Covid regulations violations, even though all the anti-vaxxers got to protest without the police laying a hand on them. 

Obviously we don’t have the same level of absolute police fuckery that those in the States are dealing with. We’re very lucky that our officers don’t carry around firearms and shoot people on mass. But some in this thread seem to be blindly praising the UK’s policing system as if it isn’t also rife with corruption.

Numerous officers have had group chats where they “joke” about beating their wives and send each other selfies they’d taken with the dead bodies of murder victims. Racial bias is still constantly affecting the black community, especially in the poorer areas of London (obviously it’s an older case, but the murder of Stephen Lawrence is a good example of how the UK police have failed in giving justice to BIPOC victims). 

There has been multiple cases recently with issues regarding strip-searching; the major one being that a young black girl was forced to do so without the presence of a trusted adult to protect her rights, and the officers went as far as making her remove her tampon. I’m sure there was other examples too - I believe there was a case where the officers were recorded mocking a woman’s choice of underwear (said woman had only been arrested because she approached a black teenager who was stopped by police and gave him a card explaining his rights), and another where I believe a religious black woman was left to sit naked in her cell as they wouldn’t provide her with modest clothing. 

We are lucky that we do not often experience what those in the US do. British BLM protests were probably about showing our solidarity and support to the black victims of police gun violence in America, but there is also genuine concern about how non-white people (especially young black men) are racially profiled and how the MET seems to have a case of systemic misogyny.

Yes, it’s terrible that there are idiots who didn’t educate their kids on gun safety. Disarming the nation hardly seems like a rational or feasible response to what makes up less than 1% of gun crime (and yes, disarming the nation would be required to enact effective gun control). Here’s a good comparison- what prevents more std’s and teenage pregnancies, abstinence only sex-ed or proper sex-ed? Just like sex, firearms are something that many teens will find themselves exposed to. It’s best to prepare them to handle the situation safely instead of just trying to avoid it all together. I’ve been handling guns since before ten years old, and I’m doing just fine, because my parents educated me. 

In regards to crime rates, the information has its caveats and it’s important you understand that when passing judgement. 

Take my state for example. We rank top 5 nationally in gun violence, but only because of one large city. The rest of the towns and cities have very low crime rates, and life there is normal, but the huge amount of crime in that one mega-urban hellhole skews the statewide information. What’s even more interesting is that the majority of these large cities, even despite some being in pro-gun states, all have tighter gun laws than the surrounding areas. Yet their gun crime is much higher. So the thing to understand is that for a lot of America, the crime rate is comparable to other 1st world countries, but in the tightly packed and poverty ridden mega cities things can be quite bad. This truth is hidden when looking at raw statistics. Yeah, 1000 people might have been murdered in Chicago, but ‘ol Pleasantville 100 miles away hasn’t seen a murder in over a decade.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cause those actions cause potential for bad outcomes.

180,"\&gt;Suicide is considered causally linked to higher rates of firearm ownership in the US and is one of the factors in consideration for efforts to reduce gun violence. Japan stands as an example of why this connection doesn't seem to hold true.  
Again, at no point was I ever speaking about gun violence generally. I have been narrowly focused on school shootings this entire time. 

This is not relevant. I never suggested we should have stronger gun laws to reduce suicide. 

\&gt;Literally never said that the US has ""no elevated rate of school shootings compared to the rest of the world."" I said that the US seems to be broadly in line with the rest of the world, adjusted for population, with regards to instances of mass violence in schools.

This seems to be contradictory and broadly false. The US does have a higher population than any single part of Europe, but even if you add up all of Europe's countries to get a similar population number the US still beats them pretty bad. This is just false if you dig into the data.

\&gt;Canada doesn't have the same rate of firearms ownership as the US however they have a pretty high rate when compared to the rest of the world. By that reasoning, we should see more school shootings in Canada and yet we don't.

It's not just about ownership rates. It's about who owns the firearms. It's about how they must be stored, how they are regulated when owned, and more. Canada has a much stricter system in that regard, and it works, which proves that you CAN regulate firearms without taking people's guns away. Something like Canada is exactly the kind of thing the US should do, but isn't, and the cost is kids in schools dying.

\&gt;You are wholly ignoring where I'm pointing out this is not an issue that can be solved via enforcement and that standard of living seems to have more to do with reducing rates of violence.

No, I recognize you are saying this, but the point I'm making is that you're not backing up with anything and it's simply false.

\&gt;Specific rules such as?

Well, we already discussed Canada. Japan also seems to have solved this problem, though they are pretty extreme with straight up being hostile to private gun ownership. Even the examples you brought up of Norway, Sweden, etc. show other models the US could look at, though again, preventing folks from storing ammunition on their private property seems like a solution that is fairly radical for US voters. Canada seems to be a pretty good model to emulate, as you admit they still have a relatively high amount of gun ownership and very limited restrictions on use.

\&gt;I do so hate the world ""reasonable."" It's absolutely meaningless.

It's one of the most important legal words in our entire justice system, so if you think it's meaningless then that's not a good sign for a policy discussion.

\&gt;I just genuinely don't believe this is ""for the children."" That will carry a lot more weight when we're in a position where several million children don't face being hungry for lack of food on a daily basis or where our educational system is even moderately functional.

Nice whataboutism! I agree there are other issues children face in America that we should address as top priorities. Just because I am talking about one thing right now that we can address doesn't mean I don't care about those other things or that I think we should ONLY do the gun thing. But that's the issue we're discussing right now, and speaking as someone who's seen what this can do to a place, it's heartbreaking.

I worked in Newtown, CT 2 years after Sandy Hook. You know the worst part of it all? The work I was doing was political, and the families who lost kids weren't even folks I could rely on. Not because they didn't agree with me, but because they had endured so much abuse and seen so little change that they just couldn't do it any more. I spoke to one of the moms, not realizing who she was, and she explained to me that she didn't mean to be rude, she just literally couldn't handle it any more. I will never forget the look on that mother's face. There is a scar on that town and it will be generations before they recover.

So you're right, it's not just for the kids. The kids are dead, and changing this stuff won't bring them back. It's also for the moms and dads. It's for the mom whose face I'll never forget. It's for the volunteer I had who gave as much as he possibly could because he didn't lose a kid and he wanted to make sure it never happened ever again to him or anyone else. It's for the other volunteer I knew who named his cat after a child murdered in her classroom. It's for the person I never met who left a voicemail full of anger and sadness and despair on my first week, devastated that America hadn't passed any legislation.

if you are a suicide risk you should absolutely not keep a gun in your home. i am one of these people! but even learning *how* to shoot a gun is a pretty worthwhile skill to have, because frankly, with the world as it is right now, i think it's going to be relevant a lot sooner than you think. which sucks, and i hope every day it never comes to that. but the american empire is falling apart, and tensions are becoming higher and higher every year. i mean for fucks sake, people genuinely *stormed the capitol.* you don't think they'll keep escalating?

189,"You’re right that the modern automatic couldn’t be widely developed until recently, particularly with the development of the cartridge (versus gunpowder poured into a musket) combined with capturing the blowback of the gases or mechanical recoil. Modern metallurgy and manufacturing techniques are the other crucial steps. 

Most all of the previous high-rate-of-fire weapons were either volley guns that fired more than one shot through more than one barrel either in sequence or simultaneously (like a ribauldequin used as early as 1300). The Puckle and similar mechanical “revolvers” (called organ guns)were Gatling’s predecessors but there are examples of this going back to the 1500s. Kalthoff and Cookson repeaters from the 1600s were more lever action ancestors to Winchesters but were leaps forward, for sure. 

All of these steps were surely driven by military need over any other concerns just like artillery development. We just can’t stop fighting over resources and ideology, it seems. But, humanity has rarely stopped to ask ourselves if we should when figuring out if we could (props to Jurassic Park). Hence, sadly, the atomic age complete with chemical and biological backup weapons. 

Two points float to mind: I’m not convinced either that the average person needs an automatic weapon or a cannon (a quick aside—private individuals could and did own cannon in early America, so there’s that!), but, FWIW, when Putin comes knocking (or a thug with a gun), everyone wants equivalent or superior firepower to stay alive and hopefully free. No different than wanting Babe Ruth on your team rather than your opponent’s. That desire is just built in. 

And to your point about the current increase in violence (and it’s not limited to guns alone), there are verifiable successful self-defense uses of firearms in America upwards of 65,000 times a year (the vast majority of which don’t even involve firing the gun — less than 1.1% end up in homicide) and there are legitimate estimates that that number may be low by a factor of 5 due to underreporting. This is in a country of over 300,000,000 firearms and an estimated half a trillion rounds of ammunition in circulation (if merely own guns was a problem you’d think we’d know about it by now!) There’s a staggeringly small percentage of criminal and legal use of firearms. Not to say we shouldn’t do anything about guns in the hands of criminals, for sure, but the laws we have don’t seem to be making a dent even in California which has the strictest gun laws in the country.

When visiting America in the past, when I was younger and my accent was heavier I was definitely treated poorly at restaurants, shops, etc, almost hostile. 

A woman at Starbucks in New York told me I should leave and let others buy their coffee because I am not American so I shouldn’t inconvenience the hard working Americans. The barista at Starbucks maybe shared her thoughts because she was also rather rude and just rolled her eyes at me, being rather friendly to other clients. This is just one example of the experience I had. 

I also dated an American guy, from the Bronx, New York. He cheated on me with his ex and got her pregnant. 

And I really don’t understand why people think that solving the problem of gun violence in the US is giving people MORE guns? The argument “to defend themselves” is just stupid. 

I am from Poland, which arguably doesn’t have a great public healthcare system, but to be honest - for the issues I’ve faced (cutting out cancerous moles, some heart issues, endometriosis, some regular sinusitis and other) it was really great for me personally. Never really had an issue, and when I wanted to go private for either a specific doctor or due to a better consultation time - it was very very affordable and the private hospitals looked great. And by affordable I mean - my gynaecologist appointment (private) that I usually go to due to my endo costs me about the equivalent of 50$. It’s really crazy to me how in America you sometimes have to pay extra to have skin to skin contact with your baby after giving birth. 

I didn’t vote in that poll because I wouldn’t say I look down on Americans, I more so don’t understand why they treat their citizens so poorly.

198,"**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

*April 6, 2022*

**WASHINGTON, D.C.—**Gun Owners of America (GOA) released the following statement in response to the violence in Sacramento, California over the weekend, which left six people dead.

“We all mourn the tragic loss of life in Sacramento over the weekend, but the response to the violence must take into account that none of the strict California gun laws prevented violent criminals from committing crimes; they only prevented law-abiding citizens from being able to protect themselves,” Erich Pratt, GOA’s Senior Vice President said.

“California’s politicians need to stop blaming gun owners for failed policies. California has some of the strictest gun controls in the country,” Pratt said, “and yet they have some of the highest numbers of mass shootings in the nation. Our elected leaders must instead restore our rights to defend ourselves and our families.”

California already has some of the strictest gun control policies in the entire country, but they continue to see historic increases in violent crime. Among some of their most radical policies, the State enforces:

- universal background checks,
- Red Flag gun confiscation orders,
- a ban on so-called “assault weapons,”
- a “good cause” requirement for concealed carry permit issuance,
- a campus carry ban,
- a prohibition against arming teachers,
- an unconstitutional 10-day waiting period,
- and several ammunition controls.

Gun Owners of California’s (GOC) Director, Sam Paredes, also weighed in on the Sacramento tragedy.

He added, “The Left will never let a tragedy go to waste, and that’s exactly what Governor Newsom, the mayor of Sacramento, and President Biden have done. Rather than being outraged at the horrific acts of violence by criminals, they are blaming the gun and punishing law-abiding gun owners. To them, it is easier to gloss over the consequences of their soft-on-crime approach than it is to look at the real roots of the violence – their response is as despicable as it is cowardly.”

President Biden and California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) have used the events in Sacramento to renew calls for their strict gun control agendas. It is worth nothing, however, that both suspects in the shooting were already prohibited from possessing firearms under California law.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
200,"1) Table 10 of UCR shows 3538 homicides where the circumstances are listed as ""argument over money"" or ""other argument""; that's 25.4% of total homicides. 16% of total homicides are attributed to arguments with firearms. Now if you wanna exclude unknown circumstances, that's your own business but that table does not say gangs or drugs are excluded from being substantially related. It also does not say arguments lead to homicides, that is a dubious proposition by you that is not expressed by the authors.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Obviously there are no hard facts as to how many guns exist in America but I was able to find that the estimate is north of 393 Million in 2019 and that 28 million background checks were run that year. 10,258 homicides in 2019 were done with guns. I don't know how you want me to quantify ""average person"" but the ratio of firearm-related murder to legal gun purchases seems to be .0366% (3.66 per 100,000) if we assume every homicide was done with a gun that was connected to a NICS checked gun purchase which we both know is a laughable assumption. 18.66 million is the number of concealed weapon permits I get from google. There is no endemic of cowboys carrying guns to settle arguments. There is a case that violent individuals are willing to use guns to settle their problems but that's a general problem with violence in the country and doesn't seem to be directly related to this.  


3) \~10% of homicides are done by a stranger to a stranger. I can find no evidence that people carrying guns are attacking each other in the street. Now I will admit that a quarter of homicides stemming from arguments is higher than I expected but that is not a good fit for talking about concealed carry.  


4) There are 2 states, Kansas (red) and Maine (blue), that have passed constitutional carry recently. Kansas' law took effect July 2015 and in 2015 they had 125 murders. They had 111 in 2016. Maine's law took effect October 2015. In 2015, Maine had 23 homicides. In 2016, Maine had 20 homicides. For comparison, national homicides went from 13455 in 2015 to 15070 in 2016. Neither Kansas nor Maine had an increase in population even approaching a tenth of a percent over that year period.  


I don't think the data supports a conclusion that constitutional carry is going to cause the OK Corral.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
201,"Fun fact: Chicago actually has some the strictest gun laws in America and still you are more likely to get shot in Chicago than in a war zone 

California has the strictest laws but still is not even top 5 safest states despite the large amount of money and little need for violence 
The reason is (according to most sources i can find) because most of the time murderers dont fallow all laws

The state with the weakest gun control laws is barely any better being the state with the 10th lowest murder rate https://www.thecentersquare.com/south_dakota/how-the-murder-rate-in-south-dakota-compares-to-the-rest-of-the-country/article_8336ed6a-796c-5e24-886e-56d0e2c5cd8b.html

So how can the strictest and weakest be so close together? Well because no matter how strict your gun control laws are criminals can still get guns by makeing their own, going to Mexico and illegally buying from cartels, the truth is most murders with a firearm is with a pistol not an ar15 or any other semi automatic rifle https://www.dailypress.com/news/crime/dp-nws-assault-rifles-handgun-violence-20180312-story.html?outputType=amp

It also gives biography of the people murdered and contextualizas it all in the history of white supremacy in the US and specifically Georgia from the trail of tears and another holy Native American site (like Mount Rushmore) defaced by the KKK to immortalize white supremacy to the Migration of Asians in the area (it mentioned a Tamil pejorative if you need a warning for it) and specifically erasure of Chinese migrant workers making much of Georgia’s literal infrastructure, to discussion of violence toward homeless, the poor and predominantly black citizens to “clean up” the city ahead of the 1996 that I have a lot of feelings about.  It has a lot of offer in terms of the US in regards to cruelty in regards of race and class and reminds me of things relating the 1968 Mexican Olympics, some the articles the other day about the Maya that protested in Belize being told vaguely to clean themselves up for the royals and a lot of other things such as sexism women experience even in death in regards to Feng.

203,"The article:

It didn’t take long for Los Angeles County’s controversial and frequently bombastic sheriff, Alex Villanueva, to lay his hands on a proverbial third rail.  
Early on in my interview with him last week, I asked about a topic that has always perplexed me.  
Although Latinos have protested police brutality against their community for decades in Southern California and beyond, the issue rarely generates the same level of widespread anger as similar cases that have long played out in the Black community. Not only that, there’s never been a case of a Latino killed by law enforcement that has galvanized Americans the way too many cases of slain Black people have and continue to do.  
I asked Villanueva to respond to this discrepancy.  
“You know, it’s a good question,” he replied. “I’ll say it’s cultural.”

He mentioned slavery, redlining, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the Ku Klux Klan and “so much trauma from way back when to the present time” that explained the Black community’s sustained distrust of law enforcement. Latinos, he reasoned, didn’t have that same historical experience with the American government.  
It was a progressive analysis, and one that surprised me. What didn’t surprise me were the dog whistles Villanueva blew on the way to get to that conclusion.  
He rattled off the names of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor and Michael Brown, all Black people killed by law enforcement and whose deaths sparked nationwide protests for police reform.  
“For every one ‘Say her name,’” Villanueva proclaimed, “you’d have to say a thousand names of people who were killed. Black people killing Black people.”  
He then named four local cases of murdered women — among them Beverly Hills philanthropist Jacqueline Avant and UCLA student Brianna Kupfer — where the accused killers are Black men.  
“And is anybody be out there in the street chanting, ‘Say their name?’” he continued. “No one is going to. And how many people die? The overwhelming majority of these people are going to die by someone who looks exactly like them.”  
I tried to point out that intraracial violence is also a phenomenon among Latinos — all races, for that matter.  
“But not to the same degree,” Villanueva shot back. He added that Black men were vastly overrepresented in the Los Angeles County Jail, while noting “hardly anybody” incarcerated there is Asian.  
“Now \[Asians have\] become more prevalent as victims of hate crimes,” he continued. “And look at the one who’s assaulting victims. Overwhelming majority are Black. It’s a rule in media that it cannot be mentioned.”  


What was the point of all this? I had no idea. But not only did Villanueva walk into this theme, he kept going back to it throughout our one-hour chat.  
Villanueva felt Black people have it far better today than in the past — and what’s keeping young Black people down is themselves.  
“The adversity, generation after generation, keeps diminishing,” he said. “You can’t say today — someone today, raised as a kid in school, has the adversity that their grandparents or their great-great-grandparents. It’s been diminishing. The greatest adversity young Black kids today face is by other young Black kids. Statistically, mathematically, it’s a slam dunk. Who trashes the schools? The same kids.”  
Then Villanueva brought it back to our original topic.  
“Today, \[activists are\] running around saying that \[law enforcement are\] slave catchers,” he said. “We don’t have the same perspective in the Latino community.”  
That’s when I realized Villanueva was even more Latino than I gave him credit for. He had tapped into the vein of anti-Blackness latent in all Latinos, one that gets exacerbated when Black and Latino communities compete for the same resources in the United States.  
This type of resentment politics is toxic — and Villanueva offered far too many personal examples.  
I get an \[L.A. Times\] article every day or every other day about the Black experience and Black life in America … literally almost every day, like clockwork. It’s, like, a dozen of them? And I just compare \[with Latino coverage\] — it doesn’t seem to equate to what the population is in L.A.  
— Alex Villanueva  
As a sergeant lieutenant in the 2000s, he said, superiors at the time told him “for every Black, we’ll have one Latino. But then when we were five times as many Latinos as Blacks, that math never worked out for us very well.”  
He remembered going to the Monterey Park headquarters of the Sheriff’s Department and seeing framed photos of division chiefs, past and present, in a waiting room.  
“There was only one Latino on the entire wall,” he said, in a lineup of about 40 to 50. “I counted nine Black division chiefs … And I thought to myself, ‘Nine and one.’”  
He read the names of those division chiefs. “It was a massive nepotism operation … All of that ended when I made sheriff.”  
Currently, there are four Black division chiefs and four Latinos.  
When we talked about the deputy gangs within his department that have brought so much public scrutiny for decades but which the sheriff has fastidiously defended, Villanueva insisted he was a victim of a double standard.  
“I guarantee you, if I was a Black sheriff in a majority Black organization, you would never hear the term ‘deputy gang,’” he said. “I promise you.”  
When talking about the lack of Latino reporters at the Los Angeles Times, Villanueva then suggested there were too many Black writers at the expense of Latino ones, at one point even saying I should tell L.A. Times owner Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, “for every Black reporter, you expect to see four Latino. Give him that number. Tell him I said it.”  
Noted.  
“I look at the \[columnists\] in the L.A. Times, how many people like you are Black versus Latino?” he blurted. “It’s you and Steve Lopez. That’s about it?”  
The Times actually has three Black columnists, compared to five Latinos. But when I mentioned one of my fellow columnists, Jean Guerrero, he winced.  
“Can’t really tell,” he replied. I scoffed. He continued.  
“I get an article every day or every other day about the Black experience and Black life in America … literally almost every day, like clockwork,” he said. “It’s, like, a dozen of them? And I just compare \[with Latino coverage\] — it doesn’t seem to equate to what the population is in L.A.”  
Villanueva did think Black issues are important to cover … and then brought up two cases of Latinos who died after being assaulted, allegedly by Black suspects. “And that got no attention,” he said. “But Dijon Kizzee?”

He was referring to a Black cyclist shot 15 times and killed in 2020 by deputies who say they tried to stop Kizzee and fired only after he made a “motion” to grab a gun that had slipped out of his jacket. Protests happened for weeks afterward, and Kizzee’s family filed a $35-million dollar wrongful-death lawsuit.  
“How much attention did that garnish? That was a guy — gangster, convicted, with a gun … He was not there for to do his laundry, or … to work out. He was there for a purpose. And he just gets reduced to being, ‘Oh, he’s just a cyclist and we’re picking on cyclists.’”  
I could’ve pressed Villanueva more on all of this, but I let him speak instead.  
It was really something. I arrived at our interview expecting us to focus on the Latino experience. Then the sheriff proceeded to offer a master class in racial … insensitivity? Cluelessness?  
Intolerance?  
All of the above?  
I’m still not sure.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

207,"Abortion: Over half of all women (about 54% iirc) who receive abortions live below the poverty line in America - which is about $16k a year, so yeah, these women are very very poor.

In 2017, planned parenthood alone estimated they performed over 300k abortions. In ten years that would equal about 3m children who could have been born, about 1% of our entire population - all to women who did not want them, and about 1.6m of which would have been born to mothers who not only did not want them, but also live below the poverty line (and that’s just the “definition” of “poverty line” - the actual number of women who financially could not afford to raise a child would likely be much higher).

That said, the vast majority of women seeking abortions are either too poor to care for their children, or are not emotionally mature enough to care for their children, or both.  You say you’re pro gun. So you clearly believe we, as Americans, should have the right to protect ourselves from violent harm. Who do you think perpetuates physical violence the most in our country, on a “man to man” level (ie billionaires cause the most physical harm in terms of our environment, and war etc; but they’re incredibly unlikely to trespass on your property or attempt a b&amp;e at your home)? Inevitably, most violent criminals come from poverty, and an abusive home life, or neglectful one, at least.

So, if you care so much about human life, then why do you apparently not give a fuck about the quality of life that fetus will have after its birth?

Adoption? Most normal people don’t have enough money to pay for the legal fees to adopt, so most orphaned kids end up in foster care. I know a lot about this actually, because my brother is a therapist for kids in foster care who have been abused. 

Furthermore, if you as an adult gun handler feel like you have the clarity of insight into “God’s Will” to determine who should get to live or die at the other end of your gun, then it’s actually abhorrent you feel, for some reason, that a woman for some reason “lacks the insight” to determine whether or not she views the tiny parasite growing in her body as a “trespasser” or not.  The whole notion that fetuses “are lives” is actually not viable in any real sense, because life does not start until after you have been born.

That said, a healthy compromise to me would be making abortions illegal in all cases *except incest, rape, or severe complications to either the mother or potential child should the pregnancy continue* (e.g. ectopic pregnancy) after 18 weeks. Why? Because there has never been a case of a fetus living outside of the womb and being nursed to health outside of 22 weeks.  That seems more than fair.

I don’t get the conservative side at all, outside of being a religious retard. Particularly because people who are conservative are also supposed to be against government intrusions into your personal life, and I can imagine nothing more personal or horrifying than being forced to give birth against my will to a child I didn’t want.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

209,"I was born and spent early childhood in a small factory town in Ohio at the edge of Appalachia. For the first half of my youth, my family lived in several rural farm states across the Midwest. Later in youth and into early adulthood, we moved to Columbia, SC; the heart of the Deep South and former Confederacy. After high school, I spent several summers in a Christian YMCA camp that was in a rural mountainous area of the Bible Belt. My grandmother came from the South and, prior to the Civil War, one line of my family involved a couple centuries of slaveholding that went back to the early Virginia colony. For additional balance, I lived for a time in the Southwest and have visited the Northeast and West Coast. That gives me multiple regions of experience to draw upon.

Then I moved back to Iowa and have lived here since. It is similar to most of the Midwestern farm states. Iowa, although not hardcore right-wing, did go to Donald Trump twice in a row; although it also went to Barack Obama both times. Iowa, even as it is moderately conservative and it's own history of racism, has more often gone to Democrats with a heavily Progressive and Populist past, not to mention a surprising amount of racial, ethnic, and religious diversity. This difference can be seen with gun data. States like Iowa have high rates of gun ownership and hunting is common. But there is no overt gun culture. It is rare to see a Midwesterner openly carrying a gun or even having a gun rack in a truck. Unlike Southerners, Midwesterners have low rates of gun violence, gun accidents, and violent crime in general. Even Chicago has lower violence rates than some Southern big cities. We Midwesterners are generally moderate and nonviolent.

The thing is what goes for a conservative in the Midwest would often be called a liberal in the Deep South. My father is an arch-conservative who is a socially conservative Christian and a fiscally conservative neoliberal Republican. He had a career as an army officer, factory manager, and business management professor. Yet he talks about a Southern friend of his who humorously accused him of being a closet liberal simply because of his moderate Midwestern attitude and worldview. Most Southerners just don't get how extreme they are compared to most of the rest of the country; i.e., the average real American. I've met some liberals in the Deep South who, on some issues, come across as right-wing authoritarians; probably because of the dark oppressive history of slavery. That extremism is even more extreme among Southern Republicans. Keep in mind that the data shows that the majority of Southerners identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, indicating Democrats would dominate the South if not for Republican voter suppression and gerrymandering.

The point is that I'm deeply and personally familiar with the lived reality and BS rhetoric about ""actual Americans"" in all kinds of states across the country. I'm also historically informed from trying to understand the cultural, ideological, and political divide between the South and North because I have ancestry on both sides of that divide, including on both sides of the American Civil War. I am a real American and an American mutt at that with ancestry from many places but particularly Britain and northern Europe. I'm the prototypical white American with family roots that are many centuries old. I even have an ancestor who was born in Indian country during the colonial period, and that was against British treaties and law at the time --- so my ancestor was an anchor baby. Other ancestors were Indian fighters, including the first slaveholding ancestor in Virginia who as an army captain was awarded a Native American POW as a slave, possibly his first slave.

As so often is the case, this is why it is so important to be informed about the world around us. This involves being historically informed but also personally informed through lived experience and simple curiosity. Don't be blindly prejudiced in assuming that everyone is like yourself and so therefore you are a real American. Having been partly educated in the South, I know the failure of the education system there, both public and private. That said, the education system all across the system is extremely inadequate and often misinforms or occludes large areas of knowledge, such as the long history of radical leftism in America:  tolerant proto-democracy (e.g., Roger Williams), democratic Anti-Federalists (e.g., Thomas Paine), etc. And don't forget that the South used to be a hotbed of radical leftist organizing, from Marxism to communism, among minorities and poor whites. As for the left-liberal supermajority, even Fox News data agrees with that conclusion.

Here are some quick statistics on gun violence in America: 

In 2018, there were roughly 40,000 gun related deaths, this number is not disputed. (1) 

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2) 

Do the math: 0.0122% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. 

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error. 

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those roughly 40,000 deaths: 

• 24,000 (60%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3) 

• 1,000 (2.5%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4) 

• 500 (1.25%) are accidental (5) 

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 40,000 annually, but rather roughly 13,500... 0.004% of the population. 

Still too many? Let's look at location. According to a review of FBI homicide statistics (6), the 10 cities with the highest firearm homicide rates (Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, Louisville, Milwaukee, St.Louis, Baltimore, Birmingham, Memphis, and New Orleans) make up roughly 20% of those deaths. 

This leaves 10,800 deaths for everywhere else in America... about 200 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others 

Yes, 10,000 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute... 

But what about other deaths each year? 

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7) 

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8) 

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9) 

Now it gets interesting: 

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10) 

You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital! 

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11) 

Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). 

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 62% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides. 

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions! 

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem. 

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well. 

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14 

Page 15: 

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010). 

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides. 

Older study, 1995: 

https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;context=jclc 

Page 164 

The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.

211,"Just a thought but how about making it much harder for the bad guys to get a gun? Pro-gun logic in America is nuts. ‘How do we solve the gun violence problem?’. ‘I know, more guns!’.

The fact that you can buy a gun in Walmart and the general availability of assault rifles to the general public is the issue here and just adding more guns to the problem is never going to solve it.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
212,"Slight disagree. America has many faults, such as in regard to gun violence, education and healthcare. But that's the big picture. Going in further reveals that most Americans are good people, and the media only displays bad things.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
213,"Understanding Chicago's gun crime rate and their issues with the massive influx of weapons from other states is something that even people that don't agree with me understand. I'm sorry you don't comprehend the basics of gun violence in Chicago 101. ??

Just to enlighten you a little bit: 1, read more. 2, America is one of the highest producers of guns in the world. We are our own problem. You cannot stop gun violence being a state in a nation of the highest per capita gun ownership in the world. The very idea of that is asinine. 

Here's a fun fact: Mexico has one place to buy guns legally... one. A family is allowed one weapon and that permit can take years to attain, yet they have.... you know what?... a lot of guns. Do you know where those guns come from? Bet you do. It isn't from Mexico. 

People like to discuss the Chicago gun laws and firearm homicide rates and why, but nobody ever discusses the Mexico gun laws with firearm homicide rates and why. ??

It's almost like we had a huge discovery and trial about something mexico and gun supply related....  American government involvement....hmmm... I can't seem to remember what it was though. ??????

214,"And of course everyone *always* follow the law, right? I know that debating guns is as controversial as discussing politics or religion, but the gun culture in America really does kill. The CDC has been blocked several times for trying to say that America has a gun violence epidemic.

Canada has a lot of guns, in regards to population, and none of the problems. Different stuff is being done, and not marketing guns to children is one of those",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
215,"&gt;And it was a pit mix and a German shepherd mix. Police made a note that the pit mix was the most aggressive and had a terrible time removing the pit from the house. 

Whoah whoah whoah. You've never met a chow chow then. Those fuckers are MEANER than pits. Strangers/animal fearing folk always gonna point out even the slightest growl as aggression. 

&gt;We can’t trust certain people to be ultimately responsible for a creature that can rip a kid’s arm off, eat grandma, and then tear the entire face off a college student.

No shit but this is America, land of the free and brazen.

&gt;I’m not advocating total ban, but damn there needs to be a huge barrier to owning pitbulls or any dog predisposed to violence. There’s too many retarded fucks out there that think they’re some mystical dog whisperer and think they can go “rescue” violent dogs from whatever fantasy “misunderstood” situation they think the dogs are in. They’re just trying to fill the ever empty void in their heart. It’s pathetic and dangerous. 

Predisposed to violence? Wtf are your [sources?](https://www.bustle.com/articles/186759-are-pit-bulls-really-dangerous-the-facts-contradict-the-stereotypes) what are you even getting at? Dogs or people???

&gt;Just because “this one time my meth buddy told me his pitty was super aggressive, but when I got there he just was the sweetest most loving thing!” Doesn’t mean people are good with dogs. Which is what most pitbull owners go on. Trust me, been everywhere in this country with the low people. 

&gt;There’s barriers to firearms. Would you rather die by gun or a dog stripping you naked and then ripping your skin off while you’re alive until you bleed to death while the dog snorts in your open nose hole and takes a shit next to you while you death gurgle?

Dude where to even start. meth buddy? METH? Oh yeah that's a responsible buddy there but At least he warned you. The barriers of fire arms are in a sense the same analogy. Guns don't kill people, people kill people. Dogs kill people because people have made them so. You blame a snake for being a primitive creature whom has a strong instinct to BITE? C'mon man you gotta have a little more sense than that. Really put it together mate. Connect the dots.

&gt;Pitbull apologists need to quit thinking with their wittle-sweet-doggorino emotional brain and start thinking with what’s best for society. 
Best for society? You have half the population FOR guns and safety and the other AGAINST. Who is right? Both American, both valid points. No easy answer. Banning pits or chastising pit bull owners is literally the stupidest shit I've heard in weeks. Does the fat guy blame the fork for his weight? Or himself? C'mon.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
216,"&gt; I'd hope not. I just want somebody to explain to me how to stop events like this from happening every day in America. 

If people had the ability to fight for their rights without being arrested or having to hire an attorney, this might stop the violence.

Except right now, you need the Prosecuting Attorney to file charges against someone, if they decide they want to. Otherwise, you are capped by the small claims court and have to do all of your own investigations.

A civil action doesn't do much, because you're probably going to pay more for the investigation than you'd ever recoup.

And remember that people often tell their victims all this when confronted, ""There's nothing you can do to me.""

So they go get the gun and prove them wrong.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
217,"And the rest of the world watches America, flooded with guns, suffer through insane amounts of gun violence, only to continue to hear this argument... I don't feel superior (in Australia), just incredibly sad.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
218,"I think what gives the swiss the advantage on the monopoly on violence is that they do not wish to use their guns for violence. It is not something they fantasise about doing. 

In America, to run into ""action"" and ""kill the bad guy"" makes you a hero. People romanticize having a body count. 

I don't blame video games for this. That's been debunked over and over. 

Before and after my service, I worked in emergency services. I worked with many police officers for years. Over half of those people have no business in law enforcement. 

You are correct, and I very much enjoyed reading your reply, that without policing, anarchy reigns. However, a great many of these cops I knew took pleasure in enforcement. They would refer to traffic stop patrols as ""hunting"". They saw people as animals. They were bullies. They abused their authority, ruined lives, and worked the system in their favor. 

They did all of these, and convinced themselves they were doing good works. That they were heros. 

It made me sick to see. Nothing could be done about it. 

That was more than half the cops I've met. The other 35% or so we're genuinely good people who only wanted the best for their community. But you never hear about those officers. The ones who do not wish to implement violence or destruction.

I have to tell you, I never understood the phrase ""The American way of life"" untill I went overseas to other places of the world where that simply did not exist. 

I plainly saw how little the world had changed from the time of the two rivers. Human nature that is. 

Have I taken life? Probably. A few timea where I was pretty sure but couldn't say with absolutely certainly. I take no pleasure in that. 

What I have taken away is my desire for peace. For people to be able to live their lives as they see fit so long as they harm no one else. 

However, as you mentioned, we are still prepared for violence. My gun is in the inside closet of my bedroom, within reach, because perpetrators of harm are a fact of life. 

Make no mistake. It's not because I'm one of these vets who's obsessed with and afraid to be without guns, not at all. In fact, it's a .22

Potentially lethal, but more likely to wound rather than kill. 

I don't hunt. I don't like the idea of harming animals. My gun's only purpose is protecting my home only in the most dire of events. Even then, I would like to only wound, where that's possible. 

If that's not possible. There's 25 rounds in the magazine.

Much like the Swiss. I am trained for war, but desire for peace.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
219,"I mean you aren’t wrong, the argument is paradoxical, but at the end of the day what I’m trying to say is America isn’t the rest of the world, culturally or socially, and for something like a gun ban, or even large restrictions, doing so would be dangerous. We pride ourselves in being strong against any sort of government oppression, just like our forefathers were against the U.K. (The part they skip is whether or not it really is government oppression). We have deep seeded racial issues and a very strained relationship between the black public and the police. Many black people are armed because they have to be, the town they live in is dangerous. We have a geography that spreads from deserts to frozen wilderness and everything in between, in some of those places guns are very necessary. It’s not Europe. And because of that new can’t just get rid of guns, without violence. 

The way I see it realistically going out is like this. Let’s just say they did what they did in Australia tomorrow. Buybacks and guns are made illegal. Some citizens will give back their guns, I would guess either people who had old guns and who wanted some money for them, maybe some guys who use them at the range too, and rule followers. However many guns are still unaccounted for. On many parts of Facebook right wingers are spouting about how the government has finally begun to assert its control, many may even be calling for civil war. Regardless of whether that happens, there would be plenty of pages saying, “if the feds want my guns they can come and take them” and actually mean it. Meanwhile crime rates in inner cities have barely changed, because when you’re already breaking the law, why would you give up your weapons? With a heartstrong president/ congress, who really wants to stop gun crime, they enact laws to increase police presence in order to protect seize these weapons.  Now you have SWAT teams raiding properties, expecting the people in those buildings to be armed, and most likely dangerous. A lot of people die, and the strain between the police and the public, which is already very strained, becomes a very big topic in conversation. Who knows if this boils over, but it could very well boil over into something way worse. 

Also I just plain didn’t want to talk about it, because its been done to death, but the gun loophole is a lot smaller than it’s portrayed as, as I left in the article p. You can’t make a living off of selling guns at a gun show, without very quickly having to require background checks. Even with the no background checks side your customer has to be licensed, which means a background check for them. So it’s not exactly that big if there at all, I mean why would we have gun shops at that point?",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
220,"&gt;I'm talking about capitalist nations conquering / otherwise bringing nations into their sphere of influence with the primary goal being the extraction of natural resources and goods. 

Before answering, I'd like to understand your premise.

What do you mean by a ""*capitalist nation*""? Is the US one? How about Venezuela? China? Russia?

Would it be different from stopping a ""*non-capitalist nation*"" from doing the same?

How do we stop imperialism in general?

&gt;During the times of feudalism, countries mostly set up trading posts in other countries, or set up settlement colonies. The only real resources they cared about were things gold, silver and spices, and even then things like spices were mostly traded for. 

In the past, people believed that wealth meant material good, the more gold you mines the richer you would be... So much that Europe managed to create inflation in gold, by importing from their colonies here in America.

Which is obviously false. Economy not being a zero sum game means we are better cooperating than interacting with violence. That is why the sanctions are working so well on Russia right now.

&gt;But when the capitalists took over, this changed. Events like the scramble for Africa happened, and the entirety of the Asia except Japan was fully taken over by foreign powers.

Yes... Government doing government things... What does this have to do with private ownership and capitalism? I at I'd say these government violated the private property of those who already lived there.

&gt;The capitalists want to keep their production cheap

But cheap products are acquires through trade, violence only makes things more expensive lol.

Just answer me this... You want a bread, you can either buy a gun and try to steal it from the baker or just give some coins in exchange for the bread. Which is the easiest and cheaper way? Oblivious isn't it? Violence is expensive and only worth if you believe economy is a zero sum game, only if you believe that in order for you to have something you must take from someone else.

&gt;This argument seems so weird to me. If it is in the interest of the capitalists to do actions of imperialism

You mean government right? I've never seem a business using nukes, and paying for an army to invade the middle east.

And yes politicians do actions of imperialism because it is on their best interest. Just look at Putin trying to take over Ukraine.

&gt;Every single capitalist country powerful enough to do so has done it, so why is it wrong to claim that it is inherent to capitalism?

Because there isn't capitalism in a scenario of systematic violation of private property. It is a contradiction to call one person invading and destroying someone else's property as ""*capitalism*"".

Not saying there won't be theft or destructive. But to call it ""*capitalism*"" is as stupid as calling a society with systematic exploitation ""*socialist*"". Do you get what I mean?

&gt;we think that there is no solution to this in the capitalist system

It feels like you are locked with the 1800 Marxist definition of capitalism. Do you realize that what you call ""*capitalism*"" is not what the capitalists here want?",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
221,"Europe had one thing going for it when it encountered the America: a history of trade with the rest of the eurasian continent. That is, Europeans had technologies learned from the muslim world of the time, and learned from the Asian kingdoms. Namely, navigation technologies and gun powder. In Africa, and we are not talking about North African which controlled some parts of southern Europe for 700 years, and others even longer. The tropical africans, because of the Sahara and the thickness of the African jungles, were at times, as secluded as some American natives. They didn’t have access to Chinese or Turkish, or Persian, trade and technologies. These Technologies in tropical Africa would take that much longer to become widespread. 

IF Africans had widespread knowledge of Gunpowder, and how to use it as the Chinese and Europeans did, by the time of the European expansion, I can almost guarantee we would have been talking about the Afro European wars, instead of the middle passage, in out history book. It would have been a story of guerrilla warfare, instead of colonization. 

Then there is the reality that a lot of native cultures have never seen europeans, some thoughts these white skinned people were gods and at first treated them as such. Some welcomed them outright even when they thought they weren’t gods. This lack of Exposure to the eastern world( Europe, middle east, China and India) essentially meant that these natives had no defense against diseases, but also against the shock that must have been looking at someone who look totally different than what you are used to.

Oh I suppose there was another weapon: religion. Organized religion was a driving force of the conquest, but also was a weapon. To keep everyone in the colonies obedient enough, you couldn’t just use violence, you had to force them into believing this was the gods’ will. 

So to summarize, an already organized religion, borrowed knowledge( primarily from  China and india, but also the middle east) and gun powder were indeed the three  main driving forces to conquer both the Americas and Africa.

With Honesty, had the Asian( primarily, the Chinese) had bee nthe ones who stumbled upon the Americas, I don’t believe the natives would have faired any better. but in this case, Europe would have also stayed a poor, farming region of the world, not unlike some third world countries, today. 

Without European expansion to the west, Europe would have stayed in the “dark ages for much longer”. Hell! Europe might even be primarily Arab speaking as the caliphate would have tried once more to conquer the European lands.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
222,"""To begin with: In most countries, there is no automatic right to own guns."" In my opinion, this isn't a very good thing because why should a state have a monopoly on violence they've proven they can't be trusted with it. 

""Governments there regulate gun ownership, some more tightly, some more leniently."" I know this I'm in the shit hole known as Canada. 

""For example, they can't own Ferraris and Porsches."" Yes but there are alternatives such as public transit. 

""At the bottom is this: People elect their government."" If it's a capitalist nation corporations are electing their government not the people. Every candidate someone gets to vote for who has a chance in hell in getting any real power was pre-approved by the rich. 

""In the countries where it is highly taxed, one could say that the government is infringing on the basic right of movement ... but people have feet."" In a lot of places, the nation has developed public transit unlike North America the shithole it is. 

""Those governments have decided to make the regulation of gun ownership costly. They have done that because the voters there like it that way."" I'd argue this is because of a stream of government propaganda and the fact they enjoy having a monopoly on violence so they can kill people anytime they like. 

""Taking guns away from all the poor (by making gun ownership expensive) is probably the single most important thing in gun control that one can do to improve public safety. "" So what poor people don't deserve to defend themselves is that it? 

""Whether that's fair or not, it works great. "" Could be fixed if capitalism stopped existing but sure whatever.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's not difficult to understand that this could happen to ANY country for any reason at any point. Anyways, I think this is the true nature of the 2nd amendment but America hasn't experienced a revolt that would require that to come into full play (my opinion). The problem starts when fuckwhits say they need a browning .50 cal for ""sport"" and lobby Washington to treat it essentially as a 9mm.

Asian hate crimes were also reported but just wouldn’t have recognizable names even if I sourced them because they were drowned out by the umpteenth other tragedies and atrocities that occurred at the time both in America and outside from the sandyhook massacre to Trayvon to Ebola to terrorists attacked and egregious police brutality against not just black peoples but all races.

So please go do some research and try to take emotions out of this. some of these number might be off slightly i havent looked at them in a while but given that homicide and murder rate are going up due to lockdowns at a faster rate than any time in history but weve always had guns tells me its not guns tells me its people struggling that would likly use a knife... just like they do in london.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
231,"To be fair.. America has never seen a war or been at war. You've engaged in war, and fought them, but you've never had a proper war on your own land. So forgive me for being crude here, but most Americans don't have a faintest idea what war is. They might have a perceived image of what war is supposed to be, but this is all information brought to them through televized media, books and news papers, or through stories told by others.

So to claim that ""the average Joe"" is carrying a gun to protect himself from foreign tyranny or evil doings, is absolutely 'bologny'.

Try imagining this scenario for instance;

The US never passed any pro gun laws, and the only gun carried by civilians were hunting rifles and shot guns, used (by a small percentage of the population) while hunting. Resulting in zero ARs being sold in stores, less guns slipping through the system, since there should be no guns, so every gun figured out/found by the state gets confiscated and destroyed. Unlike now where loads of unregistered guns are being traded all over the country, making it increasingly harder for law enforcement to control who owns what.

And this 'no pro gun laws' resulting in fewer incidents where ""nut jobs"" pull a gun on strangers in parking lots, teenagers shooting up their school with ARs and other automatic weapons. Also making it so that every gun found is a gun less in the hands of scum.

I live in a country like that. And I don't have to be afraid at a shopping mall, or late at night in a parking lot. Sure people get shot now and then, but compared to the ones being shot in the states, by accident (by people they love), I can live with the small 0.1% or incidents where guns are involved. Knowing that every time someone uses an illegal firearm, the state and the police gets one step closer to rid this society from unnecessary and dangerous weapons.

So to state that pro gun laws, allowing whoever to own almost any gun they'd like to, is a sane idea, just blows my mind. There's no need for that unless the country is at war, which America neve has been. Like I stated; you've been engaged in wars and fought them in foreign countries. But the people of America have never been in danger of being shot in the streets by any enemy. The closest you've been to danger is the threat of nuclear bombs. And no amount of guns in the streets will stop those.

I'll give you a final example why gun ownership, of almost any gun imaginable, is a bad idea. In the news a while back, we saw a dash cam footage (from America) of a cop trying to upper hand a man. This looked like a normal man, with normal clothes and a normal, well kept car. The man resisted arrest, ran inside his house, and came out with a fully modified AR (red dot sight, fore-grip, flashlight etc). I belive he even was wearing a GRU, with mags and all. And he just started shooting at the police. And I believe he killed one of them. And all this happened, just because this guy was allowed to own a AR. If the law stated that he was only allowed to own a hunting rifle, if he had a valid hunting license, the story would have been different. Even just a regular pistol would have changed the outcome of that scenario. He would have been killed by the police, most likely. But he might also have lived, since he didn't have the immense firepower inside his house, allowing him to make that decision in the first place. Without a gun there can be no shooting.

Anyways..

It's too late for you I believe.. you're doomed to live in a land where gun violence can happen at any time any day. But that doesn't mean the rest of the world should do as you do. I enjoy my freedom without fear of gun violence, without having to have a concealed carry, thank you very much.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
232,"&gt;because the second amendment was made to protect mainly against freed slaves not only that white people do not think people of color should have access to guns

That is factually incorrect. The right to keep and bear arms derived from the British Bill of Rights of 1689.

233,"For those unfamiliar with firearms it can be hard to conceive of legitimate uses for them, but in America firearms are used responsibly by law abiding citizens for legitimate purposes within the confines of the law. Thise reasons include, but are not limited to the following: 

* **Police Have no Legal Duty to Protect You** 

The job of law enforcement is to enforce laws, as they see fit. Multiple cases, up to the Supreme Court, have established that law enforcement has no duty to protect you. 

[Warren v DC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia)

* **If Police do Come When Called the Average  Response Time is 11 to 18 Minutes but can be up to 24 Hours** 

[While the average police response time in America is 11 minutes it can take as long as 1 to 24 hours if they respond at all.](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus/current/cv08107.pdf) 

[According to the National Sheriff's Association this average response time is longer at 18 minuets.](https://www.sheriffs.org/content/embracing-technology-decrease-law-enforcement-response-time) 

And we've had recent events such as the [national 911 outage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/09/fcc-to-investigate-nationwide-911-outage/) Which can keep emergency services from even receiving your call for help. 

* **Gun are Used Defensively by American Citizens Everyday** 

Due to its nature figures on defensive gun use are hard to nail down. Typically when a firearm is used defensively no one is hurt and rarely is anyone killed. Often times simply showing you are armed is enough to end a crime in  progress. Looking at the numbers even the [Violence Policy Center](http://www.vpc.org/studies/justifiable19.pdf), a gun control advocacy group, reports 177,330 instances of self defense against a violent crime with a firearm between 2014 and 2016. This translates to 56,110 violent crimes prevented annually on the low scale. This also doesn't include property crimes which include home burglaries which increase that number to over 300,000 defensive gun uses between 2014 to 2016 or over 100,000 annually. 

This ranges upwards to 500k to 3 million according to the [CDC Report Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3). 

Government agencies from the CDC, BJS, and FBI have found: 

[""Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals..."" &amp; "" Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns, i.e., incidents in which a gun was “used” by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender, have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies...""](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3). 

[""A fifth of the victims defending themselves with a firearm suffered an injury, compared to almost half of those who defended themselves with weapons other than a firearm or who had no weapon.""](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/ascii/hvfsdaft.txt) 

[""The survey further finds that approximately a third of gun owners 31.1% have used a firearm to defend themselves or their property, often on more than one occasion, and it estimates that guns are used defensively by firearms owners in approximately 1.67 million incidents per year. Handguns are the most common firearm employed for self-defense, used in 65.9% of defensive incidents, and in most defensive incidents 81.9% no shot was fired. Approximately a quarter 25.2% of defensive incidents occurred within the gun owner's home, and approximately half 53.9% occurred outside their home, but on their property. About one out of ten 9.1% defensive gun uses occurred in public, and about one out of twenty 4.8% occurred at work.""](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887145) 

[According to the BJS from 2007-11 there were 235,700 violent crime victimizations where the victim used a firearm to defend themselves against their assailant.](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf) 

[The FBI Active Shooter Report for 2016 to 2017 specifically calls out multiple times an armed civilian stopped an Active Shooter.](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-incidents-us-2016-2017.pdf/view) 

Also while defensive gun use is common less than 0.4% of those uses result in a fatality. 

* **Guns are Used to Defend People, Pets, and Livestock Against Dangerous Fauna** 

In rural, and even urban communities, firearms are used to defend People, Pets, and Livestock from all manner of dangerous and invasive species ranging from feral dogs, coyotes, Bob cats, mountain lions, bears, and rabid animals. 

[According to the USDA over 200,000 cattle are lost to predators in America each year costing farmers and ranchers nearly 100 million dollars annually.](http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/CattDeath/CattDeath-05-12-2011.pdf)

[The US Fish and Wildlife Service even employs full time hunters to control populations like those of feral Hogs.](https://www.fws.gov/southeast/articles/hunting-the-wild-hog/) 

* **Hunting Provides a Cheap Source of Meat for Low Income Families Especially in Rural Communities.** 

Hunting is crucial for America's rural poor providing a renewable source of Meat for a low initial investment cost while providing a revenue source from wealthier hunters. 

[Alaska Even has a great example of modern subsistence hunting.](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=subsistence.hunting) 

[Even PETA believes hunting is more ethical than ranching/farming.](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/hunting-is-much-less-cruel-than-factory-farming/) 

* **Firearms are Used for Sporting and Hobby Purposes the World up to the Olympic Level.** 

Sport and Hobby shooting is fun and a useful skill found throughout the world. This includes multiple Olympic shooting events. 

[Shooting Events at the Summer Olympics.](https://www.olympic.org/shooting) 

* **Death of Citizens at the hands of their own governments in the 20th Century** 

[Oppressive regimes through out the world, including major European nations, were responsible for the deaths of over 200 million of their own citizens in the 20th Century alone.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide) 

Including major European and East Asian nations. An armed populous provides a significant layer of defense against oppressive regimes abusing their populous.

Many people, who never thought they'd shoot a person, end up having a bad day and something snaps, and they shoot themselves or someone else. And those people would not have done so if they choose to not own guns.

We have weekly toddler shootings in America. Why? Because if enough people keep guns in their homes, sooner or later some child will get their hands on one. That's just a statistical fact. 

Regularly in this country fathers mistake their child for an intruder and shoot them in the middle of the night. That sort of gun violence is also a function of the rate of gun ownership.

Police shootings are also a direct result of widespread gun ownership. In countries where a low percentage of the population has guns, police shootings are impossibly rare. But in our country, because of our high rate of gun ownership, police kill people every day.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UK actually has a ton of violence, stabbings, acid attacks, etc. Peaceful has in replacing shooting with other methods of murder isn't PEACEFUL.

If people have access to firearms they want your nation will be better trained and prepared for when they are invaded, much less people won't have to adjust or learn how to use an automatic rifle. I forgot what country was it, maybe the Netherlands? Where every citizen is offered a free firearm (you can deny or accept it, most obviously will accept its free and they aren't brainwashed to despise guns) and they have mandatory courses in school on how to properly use them and safety. How high are their ""mass murders"" or gun violence? Not that damn high, not high at all in fact. 

An educated nation with the right to bears arms doesn't pose a threat to each other due to having access to specific firearms, it's been proven by some select countries that do it right. Mental health / cultural is the root cause of violence like this, America is hardly stable and non-corrupt that seems to do everything wrong on social issues.

Your initial comment attacked someone very passionately for saying their citizens should've been armed in the first place. War is a reality, war is real, it can happen at any moment. Domestic threats, foreign threats, your own government, can all be threats to your life or liberty and you can't always expect them to protect you so you absolutely do need these firearms during ""peace time"" because the cities invaded didn't receive these weapons it was too late, what about them? Or countries like Russia where their government is the problem, what then? There's so much you dont consider, the original commenter is right.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
241,"Terrorists? Siege? Does the boot taste good or is the licking just reflexive?

Rights and responsibilities is the correct take, yours seems to be subservience without rights. I have a right to own a gun, which means I have certain moral and legal responsibilities attached to that ownership. You seem to think the right itself is the issue. 

Trudeau’s government overstepped with the vaccine mandate. I think everyone *SHOULD* get the vax and I believe there is a certain moral obligation to do so, but the legal mandate clearly went beyond that and his response to denigrate everyone who protested as a neo nazi racist and terrorist while freezing the accounts of people who donated was a chillingly authoritarian response.

He also says he likes the culture, the openness. They can own a car there, stay in a big house, travel around. 

IMO also, Singapore is culturally boring compared to the US. They have such a rich culture &amp; history, you can meet all sorts of people from all walks of life who are more than willing to share their culture with you.

244,"&gt;A car is not a weapon. It can be but that's not its primary purpose. A gun is a weapon, that is its primary purpose. It can definitely be used in a good way but you're comparing apples to bricks.

How is the intended purpose of something related to it's propensity for homicide?  I'd agree that a gun is more flexible in that regard, but a vehicle is just as effective.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Same for this figure too. Also just a reminder that the person you replied to cited yearly statistics. I really doubt that guns prevent crimes that happen to almost 1% of the US population on a yearly basis but let me know.

The numbers certainly vary, I picked a set of numbers, but you can certainly find others that are higher and lower.  I believe this to be the case for both sides of the argument.  

I found this statement on an NBC news site, but no link was provided.  I went to the GOA site but did not spend too much time trying to find it.  I did find links to sites showing police shootings in 2020 to be somewhere around 1000.  This data may be old.  The 1500 number may be off, but we can certainly agree that it is not zero.  

*""Gun Owners of America states that armed citizens kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year, 1,527 to 606. GOA also said that: “Of the 2.5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8 percent of the time, a citizen kills or wounds his/her attacker.”*

245,"Everyone crossing the border illegally is a criminal, by definition, whether you like it or not.

As to the going to a port of entry

&gt;after a Border officer fired his gun to stop them from speeding through an inspection station

Sounds like a legal entry to me.

Here's another bombshell - terrorists pretend to be civilians fleeing terror, how do you tell the difference?  You can't so the correct thing to do is not allow them into the nation without proper vetting.

Where are you advocating that every nation in the world drop its borders like you are doing to America?  Do you protest the fact that Poland has now banned additional immigrants from those same terror-linked countries?  Do you demand Canada, Britain or Japan accept anyone and everyone that comes to their border?  Do you attack Mexico's immigration policies that are stricter than ours?

It isn't a matter of Americans being *terrified of all other human beings*, it is a matter of protecting our lands, our livelihoods, our borders.  Something much of the rest of the world would rather not see us do.  Americans know that a large portion of the world would like to see America eliminated as the last remaining super power, and flooding the nation with criminal aliens who have no intention of assimilating is a step in that direction.  That is why people like you lie about the criminals coming across, trying to make it sound like they are all fleeing violence.  

Did you know that none of these people actually have a valid claim for asylum in the US?  International law on asylum indicates that a person fleeing their country is supposed to ask for asylum in the first country they arrive at that is part of the agreement.  Mexico and Canada are both part of the agreement.

That means the only people who can make legitimate asylum claims in the US are those from Mexico or Canada or who reach US shores by boat.  If they pass through Mexico, as all of these are, they are not allowed to asylum shop.  They have to ask for asylum in Mexico, which has, by the way, offered it.  So all of these coming from South and Central America, the mid-East and Africa by way of Panama have no standing to request asylum in the US and should be taking Mexico up on their offer, so why aren't they?

Europe is slowly learning the lesson of wide open immigration and starting to ratchet it down.  Brexit was largely driven by EU demanding open borders.  As mentioned, Poland has locked down, so has Greece, so has Hungary and even Germany and France are starting to react.

So yes, we are aware of how much of the world would like to see us dissolve, and we're aware that there's a large population inside our country that feels the same way.  So yes we have our guns and hope to god to never need to use them, but rather be armed and able to respond then be caught off guard and begging the rest of the world for help.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**[GOA Helps Defeat Biden Gun Agenda, Calls on Removal of ALL Gun Control Language](https://www.gunowners.org/goa-helps-defeat-biden-gun-agenda-calls-on-removal-of-all-gun-control-language/)**

Springfield, VA.—Aidan Johnston, Director of Federal Affairs for Gun Owners of America, had the following to say concerning the introduction of a bipartisan compromise *Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act* or VAWA on Wednesday: 

&gt;“Gun Owners of America is glad to see the removal of much of President Biden’s gun control agenda from the latest proposed reauthorization of the *Violence Against Women Act*. 

&gt;**“President Biden needlessly weaponized VAWA to enact his gun control agenda, and gun owners are thankful that this agenda has been tossed to the curb.”**

Language known as the *NICS Denial Notification Act* still remains in this VAWA Compromise.  

Should this language be signed into law, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) would begin to:

* work with local law enforcement to launch criminal investigations into each NICS denial—which 9 out of 10 times is a false-positive denial of a law-abiding citizen; and

* deputize local law enforcement and attorneys to act as agents of the ATF. 

Johnston continued:  

&gt;“Criminal penalties for trying to buy a gun and deputizing local ATF agents have nothing to do with stopping violence against women and everything to do with penalizing gun ownership. 

&gt;**“As the only no-compromise gun lobby in Washington DC, GOA will only stand down when all the anti-gun provisions are deleted or the whole bill crashes and burns.”**

NATO is not permanently conquering land.  Russia is.  NATO might intervene, but while it expands as a treat organization, NATO does not serve as a governing organization.  It is an agreement between sovereign nations.

As for costing civilian lives?  How many Ukrainian, Georgian, Chechnyan, etc. citizens has Putin killed?  And not in the process of stopping a dictator who would murder a population, or genocide an ethnic group… but simply in order to control more land and key resources?  What NATO forces take steps to avoid, Putin deliberately does.  He will bomb that hospital on purposes, where NATO forces might accidentally hit it.  No military exercise is without collateral casualties when the target is in an urban area, but Putin doesn’t even bother to minimize those.  You are a hypocrite who supports the worse of two threats to civilian life.

One might not even show up to the polls, which I’m sure would be “well-guarded.”  Crimea wasn’t yielded by Ukrainian citizens getting together on their own, asking for, and getting a vote from their own government.  It was organized by the Russians, at gunpoint.  It was no more a voluntary handover of territory than me handing my wallet to a mugger with a gun to my head is a voluntary cash donation.

I’m no apologist for dumb wars like Vietnam or Iraq, or protracted wars like Afghanistan.  But I’ve lived long enough to see how the Soviet Union used to operate, its penchant for setting up puppet governments around it, for occupying lands long after they needed any kind of administration.  After all, that was how they got the Warsaw Bloc, and how they kept Eastern Europe in their Sphere for so long.  Putin, a longtime fanboy of Stalin, is trying to use espionage, subversion,  corruption, and in cases like this outright violence and imperial conquest to reassemble what once existed.

People like you, apologists who do not even BEGIN to apply your strict standards of criticism agains America against Russia, serve him as propagandists.  If you don’t judge Russia in the same harsh light, fault them for civilian casualities, acknowledge where Putin has not merely violated sovereignty of nations, but permanently annexed territory by force, then you have no defense for my charge.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
252,"Eh. He should lose his license forever for this. It's unbelievably dangerous and it's how innocent people die in car crashes. 

You go to jail for attempted murder with a gun and (I think??) lose the ability to buy a gun (could totally be wrong). The punishment shouldn't be much different for reckless driving. You're using a weapon (the car, like a gun) to hurt someone (kill them in a car crash). It's irredeemable.  I think we disregard traffic violence too much in America. 

You're right about therapy though! That is obviously needed.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
253,"I used to work in a gunstore and was federally licensed to sell firearms.

I own several firearms and am a staunch defender of the second amendment, which gives us the right to keep and bare arms.

There is a background check system which is required to be completed for gun sales in the US. You fill out a form called the ""Form 4473"" which is an extensive list of questions and takes things down such as your ID and Social Security number and whatnot. These questions are then either faxed or emailed to NICS, the federal agency that completes these background checks. NICS then goes through their processes and eventually comes back with one of three responses; clear, denied, or delayed.

Clear means their record is clean, and they can buy the gun.

Denied obviously means they're denied and can't buy the gun.

Delayed means the feds need more time to look into your background to make sure it's legal. For example, a dude tried to buy a gun but was currently in a lawsuit with a guy who he'd shot for breaking into his property, so he got a delay so the feds could go over the court documents and see if he was able to buy a gun.

Depending on the store you buy from, they usually have a company wide background check system as a second line of defense. Companies will exchange info for people they've had to deny sales before, and this will blacklist you from buying guns at these stores, regardless if you're *federally* allowed to buy one.

The law protects gun salesman to the fullest extent, they are allowed to keep anyone from buying a gun from them for any reason. They don't have to have a provable reason, even if they just get a bad feeling they can deny you outright.

As for prices, it really depends on the gun you buy. You can spend as little as a few hundred dollars, or spend over ten thousand on a single gun. It really varies on the manufacturer and model.

And yes, there are tons of guns in America. And people do carry them, depending on if their local laws allow it. In my state, so long as you can legally own a gun, you can carry it. In other states you need a license to do so.

Your chances of being randomly attacked vary depending on where you live. The inner cities, such as Chicago or Detroit or LA or Tulsa see a lot more violence than the smaller cities and towns. It definitely depends on your area in America.

Guns are fun, but remember that they're tools, not toys. They're one of my passions in life, I love guns and have grown up around them. Respect the machine.

Think of it like a bench grinder. While extremely useful, you wouldn't stick your hand or head in it. Never lose respect or become complacent with the power of the tool. It's the same thing with a firearm. Or a car. Never lose respect for the fact that it has the potential to cause severe damage, and even end lives.

People drove their cars every single day, but never think that day could be the day they crash and never see another day. That's complacency. Don't become complacent with anything in life, especially something with the capability of such great danger.

TL;DR guns are super fun, but super serious too. Be responsible with them. On a good day, and with a good salesman, you can buy a gun in an hour or so. Depending on your state and local laws, you can leave with it that day. And the price varies wildly depending on what gun you're buying. And you're area in America makes all the difference in relation to violent crime.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
254,Why is America significantly less safe for gun violence than other G7 countries? Let me guess. Not enough guns?,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
255,"Thanks for the thoughtful response, and sorry if I offended - my comment about 'liking guns' was intended as generalisation of the primary motivation of a significant group of Americans opposed to gun regulation.  You're right, I have no idea of your personal motivations - apologies.

Regarding the drivers of gun violence, absolutely poverty, opportunity and drugs have are all very important factors - totally agree there.  However, ready access to guns is also an important factor.  Like any multivariant problem, they all play there part.

What I disagree with is the statement that regulation is an irrelevance, however as you have presented by far the most articulate statements I've seen on the web against my view, I'm interested in understanding your view.  To be clear, I'm not aiming to be offensive or contrarian.  I don't share you view and I don't expect either of us to convince the other... but it is very rare in 2022 to find someone with an opposing view of a serious and difficult issue that is actually willing to discuss it without descending into memes.

So on regulation.  I can fully agree that regulation can be *ineffective.*  The Washington laws are a good example.  They certainly seem ineffective... which is probably not surprising.  Any regulation that can be avoided by simply travelling a few miles to a border is likely to fail.  And in the broader context of the 1980s US violent crime increases, these regulations were likely too weak to make any difference.

However as soon as you compare the US to other developed countries, the link between gun violence and gun ownership becomes undeniably obvious.  I've certainly not done a thesis on it, but I don't think one is required to [see the link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/2019_Gun_ownership_rates_and_gun_homicide_rates_-_developed_world_-_scatter_plot.svg).  

Now, I'd think one can say part of this is due to higher inequality in the US and its impact on poverty etc.  And generally crime statistics are a bit higher in the US than elsewhere, but homicide is *miles* higher.

One could also say that gun ownership isn't just about regulation, it is also about culture.  I think that is true... but the point is that it relates to *both.*  Regulation is still part of it.

If your thesis is available online, I'd be interested in a read.... at least of the summary :).  I could fully imagine that a comparison of gun regulations within the US might show they have no effect.  By international standards US gun laws are incredibly ineffectual, so it wouldn't be to surprising is the laws that are there have little statistical impact.

But I would be amazed if there was any clear data that increased regulation caused increased gun violence.  The Washington example is a function of the broader increase in violent crime, and the inability of highly localised regulation to be impactful.

In any case, the effectiveness of regulation is actually of less interest to me (Because to me it can obviously be effective), than how America might chose to regulate in a way that would get many of its citizens who do like guns, to agree to regulate (presumably in a way that didn't impose on the things they do like doing with guns).

And whilst I think that addressing poverty is probably the most effective was of addressing gun violence, I also think that addressing poverty is *much* harder than implementing some baseline gun control... Addressing poverty is probably not something that will be achieved in my lifetime.  And of course, the two are not mutually exclusive.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
256,"Yea I hate seeing these kind of comparisons of places without guns to the US. ""Yea we had these problems with violence from guns, so we got rid of the guns, and now no more gun violence!"" No fucking shit, there's hardly any guns to do it with, but did your over all murder rate drop? Did your mental illness rates magically resolve? Are people still going hungry due to poverty? If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, you didn't treat the problem, only a symptom of it, and you made yourselves less free in doing so. Not my cup of tea personally, I'd rather we actually treat the problems with our society here in the US. With how many people have run over protestors with knives, or set off bombs for their mass killings, in the US in my lifetime, I'd bet that if there were far less firearms, some of those instances still wouldn't have been prevented. Remember columbine, that watershed event that made america scared of this ind of violence? They didn't just shoot people, they also set bombs all over the school which luckily did not go off. Had those bombs gone off before the shooting started, they would have killed a LOT more people from the get go. Boston bombing is another great example of this. It's fucked that people just totally ignore this clearly much greater threat, because there's plenty we could do about the root issues, but that doesn't appease the big corps who profit off of unrest, so here we are. Oh and the real kicker is you can order everything you need to commit such crimes on amazon, with zero regulation. The next Timothy McVeigh is going to be some kid who watched too much fucking youtube and was angry at the world",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRESIDENT JOSEPH ROBINETTE BIDEN SPEAKS FOUR YEARS AFTER THE PARKLAND SHOOTING  
Reported by Karen Ann Carr   
President Biden Four Years After the Parkland Shooting  
   
""On February 14th, 2018, a gunman stole the lives of 14 students and 3 educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. It was the deadliest high school shooting in a nation with far too many of them, and it left another community — and our country — shattered by grief.    
On this difficult day, we mourn with the Parkland families whose lives were upended in an instant; who had to bury a piece of their soul deep in the earth. We pray too for those still grappling with wounds both visible and invisible. And, as we remember those lost in Parkland, we also stand with Americans in every corner of our country who have lost loved ones to gun violence or had their lives forever altered by a shooting, in tragedies that made headlines and in ones that did not.    
Out of the heartbreak of Parkland a new generation of Americans all across the country marched for our lives and towards a better, safer America for us all. Together, this extraordinary movement is making sure that the voices of victims and survivors and responsible gun owners are louder than the voices of gun manufacturers and the National Rifle Association.    
My Administration stands with those working to end this epidemic of gun violence. I have put forward a comprehensive plan to reduce gun crime that includes curbing the proliferation of “ghost” guns, cracking down on gun dealers who willfully violate the law, issuing model extreme risk protection order legislation for states, and promoting safe firearm storage, among other efforts. The Department of Justice is also helping more cities adopt smart law enforcement models like the one I recently saw in New York City, in which federal, state, and local law enforcement work together to share intelligence and remove shooters from our streets.    
I’ve asked Congress to pass a budget that provides an additional half billion dollars for proven strategies we know reduce violent crime — accountable community policing and community violence interventions. I have also requested increased funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Marshals. And Congress must do much more — beginning with requiring background checks on all gun sales, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers.    
We can never bring back those we’ve lost. But we can come together to fulfill the first responsibility of our government and our democracy: to keep each other safe. For Parkland, for all those we’ve lost, and for all those left behind, it is time to uphold that solemn obligation.""

258,"It's kind of a paradox though. You only feel so strongly about this because you've grown up in a country with high levels of gun violence and strong support for gun ownership. If there weren't so many guns available/accessible and there wasn't so much risk of gun violence, then you wouldn't feel so strongly about carrying a firearm. 

The most ironic part is I do completely empathise with your point about protecting your life and your loved ones AND I know if I lived in America I would aquire my own firearm/carry permit for the exact same reasons,  BUT at the same time I am hypocritically completely against civilian gun ownership/carrying (except of course for hunting, recreational, and other non defence based cases).

It really is a paradox, and so I'm just thankful that being an Australian it's not a paradox I have to give much or any thought on a day to day basis.

Now it's reminding me of the whole, ""how can you be against capitalism AND own an iPhone"", whether your a capitalist or not, one can only operate within the reality/society they exist in (I'm not saying I'm for or against capitalism btw, just an interesting parallel). 

Also I fucking hate Facebook, I fantasize about deleting it, but so my of my professional/academic and social life is delivered via Facebook groups and events. I have specialist medical doctors that deliver my teaching materials as well as placement and teaching time/date/location changes via a Facebook group. I could one hundred percent delete my Facebook and depend on my colleagues and friends to keep me in the loop, professionally and socially, but it just makes it so much harder to keep up to date and you can never no for sure if you're missing important information. 

Obviously the consequences are very different when it comes to political ideological debates and Facebook groups/events versus the reality of an armed burglar/mass shooting, so please don't think I'm equating them in any way.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't condone violence nor most of american cops behaviour of shoot first ask questions later, but that's just how they are taught over there. Over the years in Europe I've associated the acab movement with skinheads and racists. Not only that but the literal best person (most humble, most down to earth) I've ever known is my dad who happens to be a cop. 

I've seen a road rage incident in America that the first instinct of the driver raging was to pull out a weapon :(
If that's the thought process of a regular 9-5 civilian wtf are all the gun nuts, gangbangers and overall crazy people going to do? Not shoot if they have a gun in person, one in their glovebox, another in a drawer in their kitchen. 

I think that that mentally kind of sips over to a normal person with normal parents that by chance is a cop. Your whole country is wired differently. Acab is not a correct statement in my opinion the problem is much more deeply rooted",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
260,The government is not ineffective. 8 kids die daily from gun violence in America but it doesn’t mean the government is ineffective.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
261,"&gt;I'm sure that'll go great when the country is subverted from within, when America ceases to meaningfully exist on the world stage and gets left in the dust by the other nations of the world. When it's infrastructure is attacked and nobody can find who did it because the intelligence agencies no longer exist, what you're proposing would essentially destroy America as we know it and put it at the foreign policy whims of other rising superpowers. One need not invade with a standing army to cripple the country. Industrial espionage and sabotage 

So like now? This is already happening and our own government is almost entirely corrupt globalists who are bought by other countries and would sell out this country for money gladly and they do.

The big difference is we'd be freer and those who aren't braindead NPC's would still ignore propaganda.

&gt;An armed society is a polite society? I beg to differ, have a look at Somalia and tell me that they're oh si polite. Yes of course there are major differences, but America is already armed to the teeth and gun crime hasn't stopped existing has it?

It will always exist but if you remove guns almost entirely they'll use kitchen knives like the guy recently in New Zealand or box trucks. Go to a gun show. That is the safest place in any city there's a gun show in. Gun free zones are soft targets. Safety is never assured in this life but the job of government is not to keep people safe it's to keep them free. It's my responsibility to keep me safe.

Also Somalia is basically a bunch of rich warlords who have a monopoly on weapons in their area causing violence to gain more money and power and exploiting people who don't own firearms. Sound familiar?",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

264,"Originally from user BadDecisionDino:


What if the reason we have a culture of violence is not because people can’t see a therapist, but because from the moment they enter school, Lesson One in U.S. History is:


“Okay, kids, here’s what you gotta know about America.  Number one: You’re free to say and believe what you want.  Number two: Someone, someday, will be out to get you, and you and all your buddies will need **guns** to kill them.  And the people you will need to shoot might be in this very room or in the house next door.”


I’m sure everyone is rushing to bring up mental health, but you know what is really disturbing about our conversations about mental health?  


Not only are the conversations themselves opportunist (we only talk about it after a shooting), we also bend over backwards to talk about it in the method that most cleanly absolves us of our own responsibility in crafting the uniquely American culture of violence.


We act like mental illness is just this *disease* that you can ""catch"" for no reason at all.  Like there are just Mental Illness Spores floating around out there and one day you just breathe it in and whoop, you’re crazy!  You've been *cursed* and there's nothing we can do except hope you don’t find a gun before you get a chance to see the Therapy Wizard!


Sure, depression can be totally arbitrary sometimes.  Sometimes it's just senseless and pervasive, and people become depressed even without any good reasons, or sometimes your brain gets twisted because some enzyme made it somewhere it shouldn't have been.


But you know what?  A lot of times, mental health problems happen as *a direct response to the values and pressures* placed upon people by the society that surrounds them.  


When waves of overworked Japanese salarymen commit suicide, we don't just say to ourselves ""Oh man, if only Japan had more therapists!  If only they had access to better mental health care!""   No, we recognize the presence of certain kinds of toxicity in foreign cultures when we see it.  We say **dude, that culture needs to start rethinking their whole shit.**


If a woman forced to stay in the home and wear a burka against her will, suddenly committed suicide, I wouldn’t just blame the vague specter of “mental illness” and wish she’d gotten to talk to someone about her mother.


It should be the same thing here at home.  When we hear about the mental health crisis in poor urban black communities, it's not because they're short on ink blot tests and reclining couches, it's because they need grocery stores, and decent jobs, and cops who don't act like they're enforcing martial law.  


When we hear about Puerto Rico having a sudden epidemic in mental health problems after a hurricane, I don't think ""Gosh, I really hope those folks get their Xanax shipment soon!"" I think ""Fuck, of course.  They're losing their loved ones to preventable diseases, they don't have power or clean food or medical care, or even the comforting illusion that the rest of the nation considers them full citizens.""


No, when a society suffers a mental health crisis, they've usually **earned** it, and the nature of the crisis usually reflects the values of the society that brought it about.  Systems and processes and care facilities can help you identify, quarantine, or heal the crazy.  But culture is what synthesizes the crazy in the first place.


And the United States has earned every bit of the epidemic we suffer now.  Whether it's radical white terrorism, disaffected schoolkids, or just nutsos with guns, we've **earned** every one of these shootings, and it can't just be because these people didn't make it to a therapist on time.  


It's our values, stupid.  It's because we indoctrinate our citizens into thinking that they are *deficient* if they can't scrape together a successful life out of this crucible of capitalist indifference.  We fill the minds of the *have-nots* with shame and guilt beyond anyone's ability to fully cope with, and we fill the minds of the *haves* with supremacist fantasies that convince them that it’s okay to treat others like dirt, or they deserve to get away with anything if they’re rich.  We tell foreign children studying their asses off that they haven’t *earned* the right to live in the one place they’ve known as home, and we tell native-born Americans that their entire way of life is *under attack*.  


By kids.


But most of all, we *worship the fantasy of the gun*.  Not just the guns.  It’s the narrative that guns represent.


We’ve all heard the saying, right?  “To a man who has a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.”  Well, what happens to a nation founded upon the idea that *one day*, there will necessarily arise a problem that can **only be solved if everyone has guns?**


If you enshrine that idea into your country’s constitution, what will you get, except a society that’s always looking for the fabled “nail” that justifies the ownership of this horrifically dangerous hammer that they’ve just got sitting there?  


I mean, if that royal tyrant that our founding fathers told us to fear just...never appears, we’re all kinda just left with our dicks in our hands, right?  


Come on, we didn't need the 2nd amendment so we could own a shotgun and protect ourselves from thieves in the night.  We could've found some way to allow people to protect themselves without an *amendment*.  No, we have an amendment because our founding fathers, for better or worse, believed in the secular version of an apocalypse prophecy.  


^(edit:) Okay, not quite. I don't claim to know what they were thinking.  What I do know is that *if* they'd known how dangerous guns would get today, only someone who did believe in an apocalypse prophecy could look at the 2nd Amendment and go ""Yeah, we nailed it, don't change a thing!""  Either way, if it wasn't one then, the narrative that justifies our interpretation of it sure resembles one now.


And a political apocalypse prophecy needs an enemy, but a functioning nation can't just allow people to freely plan violence against the state, so we gotta make up the enemies, because in order for this to work, the imaginary enemy still has to be domestic and covert (otherwise, the military or police should be able to handle it).  So what do you get instead?


*There could be Muslims in your community, I say!  Muslims!  Or it’ll probably be those thieving blacks!  Mexican rapists!  Or the Deep State G-men in the suits! Or Hillary Clinton and the Pizza-Pedos!  Or maybe it's just my shifty neighbors!  I don’t know who yet, but dammit, there’s gotta be someone out there that I bought this gun to protect myself from!  Or else why would I have it? Why would George Washington warn me that I'd need a gun, if there weren't dangerous people lurking out there?*


You can’t escape the filter of paranoia that re-colors our political discourse.  How could you?  It’s built into our constitution, and placed pretty high up on the priority list, right behind free speech.  But beyond that, there are people who stand to benefit a *lot*, financially and politically, if they can get into your head and tell you who to be scared of.  Is it so crazy so suggest that that paranoid perspective has integrated itself into our conversations about poverty?  About race?  About labor?  About war?  About justice?  


I’m not saying all our problems would go away if we get rid of guns.  


We probably couldn't even if we tried.  They're like a native species by now, it'd be like trying to get rid of all the kangaroos in Australia.  There'll always be so damn many that we're probably stuck figuring out how to live with them.  It's probably baked in.  But is it so crazy to say that we may need to have a major reflection about how many guns we need in a household, or how deadly they really need to be, and how we go about acquiring them, or how we talk about what it should mean to own one?  


All I’m saying is that we might be suffering from the same issue that you would see in a suicidal Japanese salaryman.  The words “Why not just go home after 8 hours?” don’t make sense when you’re *living* in the problem.  When you're steeped in the cultural norms that push people to the brink, it's hard to step back and see that there are options, that there are entirely different and valid ways for a civilization to be organized.  Because somehow, other good countries manage to not be this way.  Like I'm pretty sure we're not the only country with bears.


But America seems like it’s suffering from a similar kind of myopia.  


It’s like we’ve simply never posited the question: “What if there isn’t as much to fear as we thought?  And even if there is that much to fear, what if the sources of those fears are only strengthened when we tell a society that they need to be ready to kill what they’re afraid of?”


We’re all psychologically (if not literally) locked and loaded but with nowhere to go.  We’ve built a cultural identity around being ready for that big threat that never comes.  


But we still have to have faith that the threat is out there! Because otherwise, well...that would mean that this whole time...we kinda just allowed our kids to murder each other for no good reason.  


So now we’re more afraid of that question, than we would’ve been afraid of the imaginary threat.  


And we're more dangerous to ourselves than that threat ever could've been.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
265,"Native Chicagoan agreeing with this post. Please come to Chicago in the summer. You'll be nowhere near any gun violence. The tourist areas are some of the safest places in the country. All of them are heavily patrolled by police and far away from neighborhoods blighted by the War on Drugs.
If you got into trouble in Chicago you'd have to really try. (i.e. Idiotically asking around a bad hood for drugs). Don't do that. The least that will happen is they'll take your money and tell you to fuck off. Use your imagination for the worst that could happen. 


It would be the equivalent of visiting Paris and instead of seeing the Louvre going into the banlieue (housing projects) and buying a dime bag.

Cool, well *violent* crime is way up. 

Yeah thats all well and good there less property crime and all, but homicides and assaults have undeniably spiked 

Since this whole discussion is about self defense carry, that's pretty much the only crime that's relevant to the discussion as well. 

You aren't shooting someone in self defense for petty theft. You are however if they are physically assaulting you or trying to kill you. 


&gt;Shootings, specifically, saw an uptick in 2020, though still nowhere near where they were when I was a kid. Though the first article you provided suggests this is an anomaly in the data.


Yes, its called a spike. Its not trending up, its spiked up. The spike will likely come back down if the aggravating factors that I described wane. 



&gt;So... I agree. We really ought to do something to CONTROL the GUN violence you are reporting. However, despite what you called a ""recipe"" for higher crime, America is seeing a continual decline in overall crime.

268,"I think castle doctrines are unnecessary at best and at worst justify homicide of many nonviolent home invaders. 
Castle doctrines serve as a legal reason not just for self defense but aggressive response. In the US common law dictates that a reasonable response to an unlawful or violent action from another which can cover most cases. This contrasts to the castle doctrines which in many cases require that the homeowner ""reasonably believe that they are under threat of imminent peril"". This requirement of homeowner fear as justification for homicide in self defense lowers the burden of proof in comparison to traditional self-defense. This contrast is deadly, even currently there is a case in Montana where a German exchange student got shot after they snuck into a garage looking for beer or pot. While it is rightfully illegal to enter another's property without invitation it should not be legal to kill them because they create a fear or they have intent to burgle them. Property is not as valuable as human lives and we need to stop acting like it is.

Hell I smile a little bit when I see a ""gravity falls"" sticker on somebody's car, we naturally assume the best out of people who enjoy or are a part of things that we are enjoying or a part of.

If somebody scratched my car, I might be a little bit less likely to assume malice on the person that has that ""gravity falls"" sticker.  A minor difference, but a thumb on the scale nonetheless.

Now take that concept, expand it out to the size of a global organization.  

Take that concept, expand it out over a long period of time.

Take that concept, and factor in that shitty people understand it.

When you factor for these, wrapping yourself in the armor of identifying as part of a group is an extremely useful tool.

If anyone questions them, it can be twisted that they are questioning the entire group... Every individual... Not just calling out a behavior.

""It's not that you have a problem with me taking money from the church, you just hate religion!""

""It's not that you have a problem with gun violence, you just hate America""

""It's not that you have a problem with police violence, you just hate the police""

""It's not that you have a problem with the outcomes of my policies, you just hate [insert side]""

And so on for a million different examples.  Shielding yourself in the identity of a group so that you can get away with terrible behaviors is so commonplace that we're just used to it... And it is insanely frustrating how eager members of that group are to defend their worst elements.

You should always be most suspicious of people who don't see membership in a group as being an ideal to live up to and a responsibility, but instead a card that earns them special treatment.  

Because a good person will say ""I am part of this group, and I have to work hard to live up to it""... A shitty person will say ""I am part of this group so that changes how I should be treated""

...

Now with all of this said, which do you most commonly see of the most vocal religious people?

Note, I specifically say most vocal. The visible ones. The ones who are waving it like a flag.

Because the good ones actually read their material;

&gt; And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.

&gt; But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

......

TL:DR - 

The vocal ones are using religion as a tool and not a belief.  And unfortunately, all too often people in the group can't understand the bad actors who using them.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
271,"I'm not a Republican and don't defend them.  I just prefer honesty in debate.  Trump did not enact more gun control than Obama.  That is a lie the democrats love to claim, but it is still a lie:

For example:

On Jan. 5, 2016, President Obama unveiled his new strategy to curb gun violence in America. His proposals focus on new background check requirements that will enhance the effectiveness of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and greater education and enforcement efforts of existing laws at the state level. As more information becomes available, this document will be updated. The 2015 plan:
  

  
Directs the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to require any business that engages in the sale of guns to obtain a federal license to do so and conduct background checks.  This requirement applies to gun stores, sellers of guns at gun shows, and sellers of guns over the Internet. The licensing requirement applies to all sellers “engaged in the business” of selling guns, regardless of how frequent or how many sales there are. Failure to obtain a license to sell will carry criminal penalties of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.  Failure to conduct a required background check will also carry penalties.
  
Requires the ATF Bureau to issue a rule requiring background checks for purchasers of certain dangerous firearms and other items who purchase them through a trust, corporation or other legal entity. It will also issue a rule clarifying that gun dealers/licensees who ship firearms have the responsibility to notify law enforcement if their guns are lost or stolen in transit.
  
Encourages greater communications between federal and state authorities on criminal history information. The Obama administration seeks to increase the dialog with states to ensure the background check system is as comprehensive as it can be.
  
Instructs the FBI to overhaul the background check system to make it more efficient and accurate. Improvements include increasing personnel by 50 percent, modernize NICS to allow for background checks to be processed 24/7 and permit better notification of state and local authorities when certain prohibited persons attempt to buy a gun.
  
Calls for increased funding to ATF for the hiring of 200 new ATF agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws. ATF is also directed to establish an Internet Investigation Center with dedicated personnel to track illegal online firearms trafficking. The plan dedicates $4 million to and additional personnel to enhance the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network.
  
Asks the attorney general to encourage federal U.S. attorneys to work with state and local authorities and groups to increase prevention of domestic violence and to prevent prohibited persons from obtaining firearms.
  
Proposes a $500 million investment to increase access to mental health care by increasing service capacity and the behavioral health workforce. The Department of Health and Human Services will finalize a rule removing legal barriers preventing states from reporting relevant information about people prohibited from possessing a gun for specific mental health reasons.
  
Requires inclusion of mental health information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in the background check system about beneficiaries who are prohibited from possessing a firearm. To this end. SSA will issue a rule to ensure that this information is reported to NICS. This rule will also include a waiver provision available to people seeking relief from the federal prohibition on possessing a firearm because of mental health reasons. Further details will be available upon issuance of this rule.
  
Directs the departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security to conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology that would reduce the likelihood of accidental discharge or unauthorized use of a firearm. Requires that a strategy for real-world deployment of this technology be prepared within 90 days.
  
Calls upon state attorneys general to focus resources on eliminating the most dangerous and impactful cases in illegal gun trafficking, and violent offenders who bypass the background check system and purchase guns illegally.
  
Removes certain legal barriers preventing states from reporting information to NICS. HHS has been directed to clarify through a rule that certain Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act covered entities are permitted to provide limited demographic and other necessary information about people with mental illness who are prohibited from possessing a firearm to the NICS.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
272,"Billionaires don't push for gun control. The don't give a shit. Gun violence will never affect them, so they don't give a single shit. All the guns in America can't stop deunionization, and every disarmed population in the developed world have better unions than us. Guns, no guns, doesn't matter. No amount of bass pro shoppers will stop or start any worker solidarity with their dumb rifles.

America is barely 4% of the world's population, whether we have guns or not doesn't matter a tiny fuck in the global sense, it's just us shedding our own blood needlessly.

The gun problem in the US would be like if in the UK (I'm controlling for population here) everything was as it is, but every day a leopard living in London ate 3 random people. Every day, chomp chomp, 3 people eaten by a leopard. We in the us would be like ""fuck guys can't you get rid of the leopard? That shit is bananas that you don't do anything about the leopard!"" And they'd say like ""oh more people die of cancer, we're really focusing on that"" but no, we'd shake our heads, ""fuckin get rid of the leopard guys, that's *such an obvious thing*""

Perhaps in YOUR hands it would be all well and good, but the fact you own such weapons as well as I is because we know for a fact there are bad people out there capable of doing horrific things when given the chance. Government tyrrany aside, the true cost of todays gun violence is not on our power to counter the government but our power to hurt each other. I would never argue to take away our guns because our nation is far too long gone to guarantee our safety if they take it away, while the criminals keep theirs. But there must be a limit.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
274,Fuck. I clicked on this before I read the title. I didn't want to see this. It's both heartbreaking and infuriating that two decades later this is still happening in America and our leaders have done nothing meaningful to stop future acts of gun violence in schools.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

276,Is your point that the number of guns in America is a problem for gun violence or not?,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
277,"The immediate threat with guns is other people; that's the point. You are far less likely to rob someone if they have a gun. What people gloss over when citing these statistics about the U.K, Australia, etc is that the crimes are still happening. Murder by gun went down, but burglaries, robberies, and murders with other weapons all increased. Do the serial stabbings in the U.K mean nothing simply because the person was stabbed and not shot? Australia doing its shenanigans now, where they're building facilities slated to be done in 2025 to house ""quarantine patients"". That's a lot of preparation for a disease we aren't sure will be as prevelant in three years, isn't it? Coincidentally, Australia's government is locking down citizens who dare to not do what the government orders. The government is using disease to isolate the undesirables after confiscating all guns. Know who else did that shit? The Nazis. Don't know about you, but I'd like to shoot a Nazi doing Nazi things. Can't do that if the government takes the guns though.

Do we ban all knives next? How about hammers? Cars? Cars kill more people every year than guns do if you don't count suicide. Do we ban unhealthy food, too? Heart disease blows gun statistics out of the water in terms of raw deaths. And let's be real, if you are set enough to blow your head off then you're going to kill yourself another way if the gun isn't readily available.

The primary points of gun ownership in America are to defend yourself and to reset the government if it gets too tyrannical. Crime has always and will always exist, banning guns because bad people use guns does nothing. Most gun deaths happen in ""gun-free"" zones and states, places like SCHOOLS and Chicago.

Let's also take a look at when these overly emotional people started popping up and analyze what may have happened culturally and with education to instigate such a transformation. Before the sixties, mass shootings and similar assaults weren't exactly common. People didn't wander into schools and kill people at random, no matter how upset.

Why?

Well, for starters, gun safety used to be taught in school. You were shown how to care for, use, and maintain a weapon as well as informed on its dangers. That started to go away in the sixties. Schools used to be places where weapons were allowed, too. Students were often seen bringing loaded shotguns to school on gun racks sixty, seventy years ago. Do that now and you could be facing prison. So no education and nobody to protect the school. Pretty easy target for an insane person, eh?

Know what else happened around that same time? Politicians and corporations started heavily pushing for women to join the workforce now that tampons and birth control were a thing. Feminism shifted from equal rights to ""hate men under all circumstances"", and the government introduced predatory welfare programs specifically aimed at minorities and poor people. Additionally, plastics and our modern disposable item lifestyle started to be kicked into overdrive. Recently, men have been told that simply being a man with male desires is ""toxic"" and they're a bad person for it. Not everyone is strong willed, so you spend your life being told you're a potential rapist who should feel bad for existing and you are probably going to be a little fucked in the head. 

My personal opinion? It was all done to consolidate power and money and it worked. Double the labor force and you halve the value of labor, destroy the family unit and you have dependents who will vote for you no matter what with the side benefit of there being more households with one income. With our tax code, two people filing separately gives more taxes than two people filing jointly. The influx of plastics and female hormones flooding our sewer systems and by virtue of that, our water supply, is really messing with men on a genetic level in tandem with the relentless assault on masculinity. Yeah, that's not going to end well.

Marriage rates have steadily declined since these things happened and the nuclear family is virtually gone in a good portion of the country. Sperm levels among men have dropped off a cliff over the last sixty years to the point where 30 year old men have less or equal amounts of testosterone in their body as an 80 yesr old man. 86% of all single parent households are single mother and ~70% of inmates come from single family homes. Correlation=/=Causation, but those two statistics only started to correlate the last thirty years or so. Strange coincidence that most men who are violent and unstable have been attacked socially and did not have a father to drill it into their heads that it was all bullshit and to ignore it. A majority of violent crimes are committed by young black males; the community with a 75% fatherless rate, where gang banging is glorified, education is shunned, welfare is used in abundance, and gang violence is a way of life. At some point we have to acknowledge that all these happenstance correlations have SOMETHING to do with each other.

As someone who is relied upon as a troubleshooter at their shop as an electrician, I can assure you that experts are not always correct. Everyone I've met who is a professional in their field will readily admit that fact, so if you have ""experts"" who insist they're correct no matter what data is presented to the counter then those people are not ""experts"", they're propagandists. 

John Hopkins released a report showing that the lockdowns aided mortality among Covid victims by .2%. With 600,000ish deaths reported, that is 1200 people. And that's assuming all those deaths were Covid deaths rather than someone dying WITH Covid. I won't even get into how many people, children included, are now severely depressed, have committed suicide, the upticks in domestic violence, etc. It's a lot more than 1200 people, that's for damn sure.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

279,I could understand that angle. I think if you live in a place like Ireland with relatively low crime. And you’re confident that nobody is gonna try to stab you at any point. It is very easy to think “why would anyone anywhere need a gun” and seeing it applied to America where the situation is quite a bit different has been irritating at times. One thing I did find kind of weird and funny are how bashful and ignorant some English guys have been to me about American gun law. Devolved so quickly into them yelling about school shootings being a massive societal plague when gang violence and property crime kills magnitudes more people. I appreciate your opinion and wish you many more years of not dealing with guns and not getting stabbed!!!!,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi, alotta lies, yesterday my reddit didn't work, this was the reply I wanted to post. I tried to go parody and go in several different directions. 

Whats up with egl pissing games? I'm surprised Apex Gamma was so cold during that stream this week in January 2022. Apex does hilarious punidtry, opinining. Then Karl was called mean names. Snoo is frens with Karlie, Karlie good pple sweet kind. Oso is hilarious. What I thought ipse and Sam are friends? I thought everyone was over the RSJW or retardedsjw, republican sjw, rightwingaltrightwignatsjw, altlightLeftRight sjw grifter. What would someone bring up Mexican, Latino, ?? Mom taught Latin, Spanish and dad taught Italian. My parents are mixed per their culture in their Era of 1975. A Dego wanted a Serbian Orthodox Queen. See, Janet's parents are Gods and Goddesses in law and medicine, they bears four kings, three queens. The Russian Italiansbeared three gods too! But they were light and dark.

Dad said why are you hanging out with gays? Did you see the guys your a fan of from my chemical romance make out for money ?? Are you this stupid a daughter to ever dip your holy toe near such pple? You might disagree with mother Hillary but you are hanging out with deplorable pple. They will ruin your 30s. Go ahead and try to mux with them. You aren't White enough, Straight enough, or good enough, you are farm stock, farm stock looks at these idea thugs or idea brokers as boys too smart for manual labor and they are going to care FOR you?? I taught you to weld to never depend on a man because this is 1998 look at your life, look at your shitty peers, get the fuck out of here go out earn. 

Then it donnes on me, Gavin and Milo Pulse Club-----im the American dream, I've accomplished love, they have empty shifting sands of words....I feel sorry for the grifters and I'm happy David Hogg is ok. 

Alotta lies, this post is old, 157days, last year David Hogg wasn't acting at medcircle. Medcircle is not a grift. Omg, David is a work in progress, he likes boating, he really lead the way with awareness for men. 

We all have the same issues. I couldn't hang out with pple that hates so hard on the right. I'm sorry I go a little dsyrelgated but it's research? It's showing pple whom are smart also fall for things or get taken advantage of it's ok. I feel sorry for the abuse the grifters had as children. Today I view them as others viewed me a cry for help. The right is filled with such dsyrelgation alcohol immaturity egotistical attitudes but that's ok!!! Noatter what they are loved by their families. I let go with love. 

I'm worrying about others because we are getting shut in, gaslit, shunned by family, I want everyone alive in 2030. All the babies born 2019 into today ARE MIRACLE BABIES. OMG WE GOTTA PRAY for their success. 

From Saturday 21 20222

And the day of a peaceful protest over Covid did twitter trend this. 

During a pandemic where pple are trying to get food banks stocked. In my poverty I'd dream of a gold or yellow trimmed organic fair trade ethically sourced cotton pillow with my peer reviewed paper on American narcissism and crowder mug? Wait I think I confused lindell and something else. 

I'm sorry I go full mood swing psycho motor retardation. It's been a wild month. 

Why is twitter so mad? 

Is it Covid rage? 

Paypig rage? 

Everyone has a iPhone, smartphone,food, smokes but twitter bots gotta be mean to a peers rep trying to recover - Sad. Metokur ignored that and focused on jack Murphy. Such priorities. 

Twitter safety council must be aware Twitter is a negative trajectory for recoveries. ?????? Twitter Shareholders matter more than social media customer service. 

Also poor Karl was made fun of. Snoo had hurt feelings, Karlie caring. GroupHug for Karl. 

Then the gong session scared poor Icke. So loud it was muted. ????????

And today the plague walk. 

A plague walk?! 

I still want an entire Congress and Senate to serve 30 days jail time for 1/6 (baby steps) then again another kind of hell are no term limits. I hope their wives make their lives hell on earth for what citizens have to endure. We all have goodbye in the morning, it's important to return home. Can you imagine smartphones, police, a kid with a gun and not armed students? Jesus Christ. 

A plague walk today. 

Why are you marching? Research the dancing plague. 

Tucker Carlson at foxnews this week explained to the world that media war Hawks want a war. Tucker you piece of work, history says your a crazy maker. Not one fucking ad or time on CNN or fox for mental health issues. So Covid is over. Shite, I almost root for grifters. 

Canada sent Ukraine$120 million to what buy apples? 

America is pushing wars and men would rather wear a dress than waste one drop of blood. 

You are marching into every single war with a toolkit of coping skills?!?!??? And what a gun from the military?!!? Jesus Christ. 

That's what women secretly speak of.

Covid has to blow over. 

Pple need a solid decade of mental cleansers. 

I will march with Hogg.

We all will.

How many here felt the sting of violence? 

Women don't understand it. 

Then I'm worrying about my friends again. They are live at dlive right now and dlive won't load. 

I want to see zero participation but the media in DC. No one in their right mind is in a protest, ask Wolf Blitzer. No normal caring employer sends their staff into harms way. No normal twitter allows toxicity as free speech. Dsyrelgation as leadership. ??????It's why I Support every single endeavor of others. I know it's a mess in progress. But still, love says, love support others relentlessly. I'm working on methods to help men raise their vibrations. 

I'm sorry for spiraling. My mind goes in ten directions over certain topics. Sadly, the other personas of Snoo fear men and only feel equal when I'm far from them they never view me as one of them. I welded a life without the insights of Hogg. I fused a life without listening to anyone else. Today I listen learn change because life at every age and every stage has such Bright Light. Life is never a bummer never old never crummy.

Near pple like you all, Hogg, etc., minds feel better. We can objectively look at the importance of outreach. I pray for others that's more effective than links. 

I feel like I should stay or link to his talks but I saw how any links I link cause trouble elsewhere. I've seen where links get destroyed by haters. Why share the healing?

Im sad there's no cure, no healing just mgmt, baby steps and attempts at care. I wish I too had a magic wand and could fix dtuff. I'm broken hearted industry after industry is gutted. Renaissance looks like this? Give it a decade. Life unfolds like a beautiful flower. How do parents say goodbye and their child doesn't come home? 

What if it's no one's direct fault for late orders? What if, what if, what if...

David Hogg s mannerisms are peaceful like sam's, peaceful kids. I want a peaceful parenting world a peaceful life. Look at how good our young pple are? Sure their friends laugh and mock them but look how good, kind, strong, robust they are. I'm worrying about babies. When I was hospitalized last month I felt children in the room. I opened my eyes and got up a little woosy. The floor was needed for five small containers for five special births. Omg. Jesus Christ. Tubes. IVs. I looked at their future and cried harder. 

And where is Stefan???

Monetized into silence and boring topics about copypastaracemixa. 

I'm proud of our David's. 

I hug our Karls??. 

I am accepted here despite my other beliefs cause I'm real. 

What a joy it would be to see all the lines ended and everyone stay friends. Extending lives with love. Extending lives with hope.

Alex Jones son and David Hogg want the same things a young man wants: a future. They could all place ego aside to see they are all going to be great in life. No threat exists. Jesus Christ the hyper vigilance! 

The political rhetoric grift got our kids killed it's not the public schools. When it begin? The 90s. School shootings. 
There is a Netflix movie, what to do about Kevin. I'm probably banned here. I just go maternally insane over things.

Another reason I can't drink is for them. I exist for them. 

I regularly obsess about services, possible needs, anything to provide them with what they need to succeed. 

We have elderberry gummies? Cure. Progress. New therapies like doing the opposite of any sad mood. Pple or my old friendd would comment as to the legitimacy of psychology and sure enough if it's not economics it's Brain Self Love Care that some pple gaslight. Because they are the walking talking DSMs, not us, we are stuck trying to figure out how to love others more. It's exhausting. 

I think the problems we think we have will be solved in soon time because the kids are making the solutions. ??????if we all support them then we all succeed together. 

Why is this so hard for others to grasp Teamwork. Teamwork, collaboration authenticity prevails.  The American media, the American dream, what a surprise project that we all get hurt in life.?????? I wish we all have less hurt, less hosed, less sad. CNN fox and twitter can start trending terms of joy, actions of service not terms of service.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

288,"&gt;Well shit, I mean, why didn't your gun laws stop it? I'm all for making it harder to own a firearm but the real discussion should be about mental health.


Although the essence of your statement is correct, the structure of it is flawed, and this flawed structure is exactly how the gun lobby in America has been largely successful in defending an otherwise indefensible position.

Mental health absolutely *should* be treated much more seriously and without the stigma many societies have attached to it. The more readily an individual can access mental health care, the more likely tragedies in which a perpetrator was suffering mental anguish can be avoided without the introduction of violence, firearms or no.

But, suggesting (or simply implying) that the truth of the previous paragraph somehow nullifies the viability of gun control laws to mitigate gun violence, is a smoke and mirrors game, often employed by pro-gun advocates, that seeks to avoid the underlying fact that *both* strategies are required to limit gun violence.

Likewise, pointing to a shooting in Germany, where gun control laws are significantly stricter than in the US, and suggesting those laws are ineffective because they didn't prevent the shooting, is akin to declaring that masks need not be worn because they are not guaranteed to prevent the spread of COVID. The fact that they help significantly reduce spread relative to how easily they can be implemented, is casually ignored by such an argument.

The world, and its problems, are complex. This complexity is often frustrating, confusing, and frankly, frightening. For this reason, positions and arguments that take a gray and uncertain issue and force it into a binary and reductionist framework, however unrealistic, are attractive to us. Saying that the laws didn't work because a shooting happened feels straightforward and satisfying, but only if one ignores the overwhelming reality that the situation in question is vastly more complicated.

Some problems are so involved and multifaceted, that their solutions must be equally if not more so. In the matter of gun violence, a strategy to address mental health isn't only an appropriate solution, it is an *essential* one; along with numerous *other* strategies like gun control legislation, which is *also* essential. No single approach will solve this issue. Rejecting any one viable, contributing strategy cannot be justified by suggesting some other strategy is wholly responsible for creating a solution.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Something I still don't get is why some Americans seems to their country to be free and tend to feel quite patriotic about America, even though the only thing about America I understand could be seen as free, is the right to bear arms(which funnily enough removes more freedom than it gives) and the capitalism in the country which has created huge inequality.

295,"Lot of people in this sub aren't getting it.  I'm not surprised, because this sub has taught people to think in strict binary terms, ignoring nuance.  Guns in America are an incredibly complicated issue that are irrationally divided among political lines.  Neither party or grouping of people (liberal versus conservative, to say nothing of leftists or other groups outside the American binary setup) is right. Neither is entirely wrong.  There's a **WHOLE FUCKING LOT** of gray area here.

But let's focus on just this post and why it shows that OP (and people that think this is selfawarewolves material in the first place) are mistaken.  The *entire point* of the OP and the first commenter is this idea that America can ""ban the guns,"" or ""ban the dangerous guns"" or whatever their particular favorite location for the goalposts is.  By doing so, this means fewer/no shootings - can't have a shooting without guns, obviously.

The problem is that this goal - ban all or most guns/ban all of the dangerous guns, whatever - **is functionally impossible.**  No other country on Earth has or has *ever* had the level of proliferation we have here.  Our nearest peers own something like 35 guns per 100 people... we own **120** guns per 100 people.  We *literally* have more guns in circulation than we have people in the country, and those figures are from 2017.  They don't count the *dramatic* acceleration we saw in gun purchases and first-time purchases (many of whom *were not conservatives*) in response to Trumpism, open violence against unarmed protestors by pigs, concerns over civil instability in the wake of the pandemic and Trump's refusal to act on it, etc.  Our per 100 amount is likely significantly higher now.

So that's one factor.  What's another?  How about our gun culture (for better or worse) being *ardently* against complying with gun laws?  People will *generally* comply with simple laws like background checks (so long as there's no registry involved, mind) and things like that - they aren't really that onerous and they *do*, generally, make things a bit safer.  But bans and the like face very high rates of noncompliance, *especially* when manufacturers and end-users will simply modify their guns to skirt the exact wording of whatever gun law comes into being (as we saw during the 1994-2004 assault weapons ban and we've seen repeatedly as California has written and rewritten gun bills.)  There is also a significant non-zero portion of people who really are fucking insane enough to actually fight to protect their guns.  These people are insane, yes.  But they will still shoot first if they think that Uncle Sam is coming to ""take their guns.""  Reference events like Ruby Ridge and Waco, and how they *directly* lead to the radicalization of Timothy McVeigh and lead to the Oklahoma City bombing if you need examples of why ""well who cares?  Shoot them and take their guns!"" is a *terrible policy.*  Moreover, cops don't like being shot at, so they are *highly* unlikely to enforce laws that present them with a significant chance of getting shot at.  On top of *that*, many of the cops in this country are part of the same group of ""muh tyranny"" lunatic fringe groups that would shoot at anyone coming to take their guns in the first place, or are at minimum sympathetic to such ideas.  So not only do we have an absurd level of gun proliferation in this country, effectively enforcing new or more stringent gun laws is going to be incredibly difficult.

That's two factors.  How about a third?  No other country on Earth has anything like the Second Amendment in its legal foundations.  We can argue about the specific wording and interpretation of the amendment til we're blue in the face, but it doesn't really matter.  So long as the Second stands, any *federal* gun laws will face constant attack and scrutiny for constitutionality, and with the SCOTUS likely to have a conservative advantage for years to come (yes, yes, Democrats could stack the court and then Republicans would just stack it back in their favor 4 or 8 years later, so don't pretend that's a solution), it is **incredibly** unlikely a federal gun law on par with what the Aussies (since they're a favorite example of ""see gun laws work!"", even though that's not even accurate...) would survive long enough to have a meaningful impact, let alone something more stringent and comprehensive like what the Brits have.  The effects of gun bans need *decades* to be measured and felt in any meaningful capacity - indeed, there is widespread consensus that the 1994-2004 AWB in our country accomplished fuck all, with some reports suggesting that we *might* have begun to see results if it had been around for another 10 or 20 years (and that's a *might*, not a certainty.)  Certainly, even if we passed a bill like what the Brits have, gun violence would be virtually unchanged for *years* afterwards.  And, likely, would see a sharp uptick in the domestic terrorism type of crime as backlash against Democrats and liberals for passing such a law besides.  It's much more possible to pass *state* laws due to how circuit courts work (something that is generally unconstitutional can survive based on circuit court rulings and SCOTUS declining to weigh in on it - see California), but anyone that's waded into the practically daily discussions on Chicago gun violence can attest that state laws are not especially useful.  Even if you could successfully ban sales and possession of guns in your city or region, there's *nothing* stopping someone from obtaining a gun from a more permissible area and bringing it with them.  This, of course, is a federal felony, but people planning on shooting up rival gang members or breaking into someone's house are generally not concerned with that in the first place.

That's three *major* factors that no other country on Earth has ever had to deal with that pretty much put a hard stop to any sort of ""well just do what &lt;insert other country here&gt; did, it clearly worked there so it will work here too!"" argument.  And arguing about wishful thinking and fantasies is pointless, so I don't even see a point in arguing about whether or not it *would* work here if we could somehow bypass those three factors - it's irrelevant, because it will never happen in the first place, so why waste effort?

And keep in mind, that's just three of **many** factors at work here.  Leftists, LGBTQ, PoC, and other at-risk people are probably not going to look fondly at the idea of being made to give up their rifles in light of increasingly violent and active fascism and bigotry, *especially* when those types of people will *not* give up their rifles no matter what the law says (and, as often happens, are supported by the very cops that we're expecting to disarm them.)  Like, it's a hugely complex issue.  I'd really appreciate it if we could just not be fucking *Reddit* over it for just this once.  It doesn't benefit anyone.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

297,"Almost everyone who legally obtains a gun, uses it for home/self defense. As a brown dude who grew up around unsafe conditions and gang violence, i would be more worried about how many people have illegal guns used for crime than what the average citizen is capable of. 

Seen some fucked up stuff and it never gets attention, never. Everyone wants to talk about regulating guns for law abiding citizens, but never face the issue of gun violence in cities by gang members etc. there are daily shootings, some that would equate to mass shootings in the US, every day, yet they get overlooked to focus on people who legally own their firearm. I grew in places where kids were spending their free time shooting at each other, especially on the weekends. 16-17 years old and having shootouts. 

That is a reality that the average person cant even fathom. Do normal neighborhoods have holes riddled in their homes, do they have a “dig out” where you hide in your home in case of stray bullets, do they have the occasional body in the street, do they have people shooting at every birthday party, do they have people throwing guns in rivers after they commit a murder, do they shoot their neighbors? No, they do not. Most people in America haven’t seen a gun, nor even heard a gun shot. The average person doesn’t live life hearing or fearing shots being fired and people screaming. Normal people smell bbq grills, freshly mowed lawns, and the neighbors kids playing in the street.

 Yet, once again, it baffles me that we are here talking about the actions of someone deciding to legally own and operate a gun. Mind boggling that the gang violence is literally never spoken of, yet here we are discussing the moral and ethics of a law abiding citizen deciding he wants to have a gun in his house.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The most salient conclusions reported in his paper were a 25 percent reduction of gun homicide rates with an increase in social mobility; a 19 percent reduction linked to greater trust in government, media and corporate institutions; and a 14 percent decrease tied to a rise in welfare spending, such as for public-assistance programs and unemployment insurance.

\&gt;If you're vying for American-style access, you're going to encounter resistance from a general narrative that sees mass shootings and violence as stemming from American firearm policy.

&amp;#x200B;

Exactly, This leads into what I stated previously saying that people take the most basic straight road for blaming something. Guns can enable crime but crime is caused by so many factors mostly being poverty/mental health.  Guns make it easier for killings but to blame guns and not focus more on the people is backward to me. For example, Japan has had more deaths in mass stabbings in 6 years (86) then we had in mass shootings since all the mass shootings combined since 1989. a lot of people in cities want guns banned but id bet money they are basing their decision on the current American situation and not even bothering looking at what Canada has even done to prevent what is happening in America to Canada so when we see any hint of a mass shooting a lot of people blame the guns.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;If that's the national conversation, imagine what someone whose bitterly saying online that all of Canada's regulations need to be tossed so they can have access to an anti-material rifle, looks like to the average GTA or Vancouver resident.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole reason the .50 cal (and other calibers that aren't seen as anti-material) discussion was brought up in the gun community is because it is clearly a law to look good to voters and have very little to no effect on crime because the vast majority of people committing crime can barely afford to live let alone spend $5000 on a 50 cal. Much like the city people taking the extreme view of banning all guns, the gun community feels personally attacked. Of course, I disagree with anyone wanting to throw away every single regulation regarding obtaining the ability to, acquiring, and store guns but there has to be give and take from both sides, and the laws that have been implemented in the past 3 decades have been very much so more take than give from the opposing side of guns ownership. 

Everybody has their hobbies and it just so happens that over 2 million Canadians enjoy the exciting hobby of shooting and that just so happens to be the hobby that gives us joy. I'm sure you can see how some people can feel very attacked and take extreme sides which is wrong for both parties but that's just the primal side of humans, when someone interferes with something you love that isn't hurting anybody else it's normal to feel enraged. If guns were truly as evil as many city folk say guns would have been banned a long time ago.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

304,"Well, the USA isn't nearly as bad as the news/media portrays it as. It's still one of the safest countries on the planet with extremely low violence and crime rates. Even gun crime is absurdly low except for a select small number of cities. If you excluded those cities the national average would drop so significantly it would be roughly the same as most European nations. [The reason why we have such huge numbers is because they include suicide by gun as well which is important because suicide by gun is roughly 59% of all gun crime with 38% being actual homicides](https://everytownresearch.org/report/gun-violence-in-america/).

In the EU suicide by gun accounts for roughly 76% of all gun crime with 23% being homicide(these are not correct percentages due to the missing data which would put the percentages lower making them closer to the US's). It's important to note though that there is a margin for error due to the statistics being inaccurate or missing proper data making these percentages also inaccurate as they could go up or down significantly. For example the data only includes 2000 to 2012 for gun deaths, and homicide but only 2011 for suicide by gun which makes it very hard to know actual total gun deaths per year which is in contrast to the US's data which includes all kinds of deaths by gun in it's data set.

326,"Following an economic crash in the early 2020s and increased political division and violence, the National-Populists of America under Tucker Carlson and the Democratic Socialists of America under AOC split from the GOP and DNC respectively, each offering more radical solutions to the nation's problems. After a contesious election in 2028 and a strict gun-control policy by unpopular incumbent President Kamala Harris, a coalition of right wing states seceded from the Federal Government and ratified a new constitution, taking with them disaffected members of the military, police force, and local militias. The 2nd Civil War to determine America's future would soon break out.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
327,"&gt; n the summer of 2015, a chimney sweep in Elgin, Oregon, redrew the map of the American West. “Imagine for a moment Idaho’s western border stretching to the Pacific Ocean,” Grant Darrow wrote in a letter to the editor of his local paper. Rural Oregon, he insisted, should break its ties with the urbanites of Portland and liberals of Salem, and join Idaho. “The political diversity in this state is becoming unpalatable,” he argued. “Rural Oregonians in general and Eastern Oregonians in particular are growing increasingly dismayed by the manner in which Oregon’s Legislature and Oregon’s urban dwellers have marginalized their values, demonized their lifestyle, villainized their resource-based livelihoods, and classified them as second-class citizens at best.”

&gt; In the half decade or so since Darrow’s diatribe, a simple and outlandish idea, percolating in rural Oregon since the 1960s—what if we were just Idaho?—has grown into a grassroots secession movement. Last month, Harney County, in the high desert of eastern Oregon, became the state’s eighth to pass a nonbinding ballot measure supporting Darrow’s proposal. move oregon’s border signs now dot the region’s empty highways, and Mike McCarter, a retired agricultural nurseryman and gun-club owner who runs a group pushing for the boundary reshuffle, travels the state in a bright-red trucker hat bearing the slogan. “We don’t care to move, because we’re tied to our land here,” he told me recently. “So why not just allow us to be governed by another state?” He mentioned a supporter so certain that her property will become part of Idaho that she already flies its state flag on her lawn. “We’re going to be Idaho,” she told him.

...

&gt; The reasoning comes across as amorphous and quixotic, but the Greater Idaho referendums have passed in eight out of ten counties where they’ve been proposed, making Move Oregon’s Border the most electorally successful secessionist movement in America today. Two more counties will vote on the measure next year, and this month, state Senator Lynn Findley begrudgingly said he’d consider introducing legislation related to the border move. Over the past decade, every state has flirted with a secessionist petition of some sort. Two-thirds of Republicans in the South are in favor of secession; elsewhere, Illinois counties are asking to be free of their directorate in Chicago, and West Virginia has just offered to take in three conservative-leaning, rural Maryland counties. Even this part of Oregon is nestled between areas that some people hope will become entirely new states: the State of Jefferson, in California, and the Liberty State, a libertarian utopia pushed by former Representative Matt Shea, in Washington. The Greater Idaho solution appeals in part because of its political pragmatism; moving a border is hard, but it’s easier than creating a new state.

...

&gt; For McCarter, [the main organizer behind the ballot measures,] such a severing is commonsense, and the map of Greater Idaho, carefully carving out Bend, doesn’t look any more puzzling than a gerrymandered congressional district. The urban-rural divide is so intense that separating the two is the most sensible path forward, he told me.

&gt; Joining Idaho would keep rural Oregon the way America used to be, McCarter explained. In his narrative, Salem is the villain forcing eastern Oregon counties to comply with laws that seem irrelevant or offensive to their rural setting, rules that have no bearing on their lived reality. Recent redistricting only compounded the sense that representation would never skew in their favor; McCarter feels his supporters’ voices are drowned out by urban ones—the culture over the hill, across the Cascades. Portland is in the midst of its most violent year ever, including more than 1,000 shootings so far. Struggling economically and anticipating the full collapse of industries that used to sustain them, McCarter and his group clamor for popular sovereignty.

&gt; Move Oregon’s Border’s true purpose is threefold, McCarter told me: First, obviously, to move the border. Second, to send a message to the state legislature “that you’ve got some very unhappy people, and here are the reasons why.” But the third is more subtle: “It provides a vent for all this anger.” McCarter sees himself as a peaceful guy proximate to violent movements. When he retired from working in plant nurseries and started running a gun club, members of the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters, and the Project Appleseed prepper group practiced at his shooting range. People’s Rights, the anti-government activist Ammon Bundy’s new far-right network, has asked him to speak at its events. “I know there’s some people that have talked about ‘If this continues on, people are going to pick up their guns,’” McCarter said. “Rural people—their values, the way they live, their faith, their freedom—are closely tied to what Idaho is, so why not adjust the border? Just let us go peacefully.”

...

&gt; Greater Idaho supporters I met often articulated the movement’s aims in the same terms McCarter and Kreitner used. “This is actually very American, choosing our own government,” Gilson, the county captain, told me. “It was all about choosing our government when we left England in the Revolutionary War.” Some proponents of Greater Idaho swiftly offer another American revolution—or another civil war—as the backup plan if moving the border doesn’t work out. 

...

&gt; In McCarter and his allies’ eyes, they’re preserving a version of the last American frontier—lands still unfettered by the progressive ideas from cities such as Portland that are seeping into every place in America and threatening rural life. It’s a charming myth. “The frontier fantasy of armed white men who made the West and can remake it because they are autonomous or independent from political forces back east is something that really probably fires the imagination of a lot of people,” the historian Joe Lowndes, of the University of Oregon, told me. 

&gt; Oregon was itself founded in dispossession. Its constitution banned free Black people from living in the state. “It’s difficult to disentangle the nonthreatening parts of this group from the threatening white-supremacist aspects, because the region gained a reputation as a safe home for these ideas,” Steven Beda, a historian at the University of Oregon, told me. “It’s about articulating a rural identity, a return to a rural past; and ruralness is frequently used as a synonym for whiteness. Nostalgia is often rooted in white-supremacist ideals—‘we were all better off before people of color started demanding rights.’” Most supporters I spoke with skewed toward retirement age; they diligently collected signatures at farmers’ markets and gun shows and chatted in small groups at thinly attended meetups in church basements, peddling a far-fetched cause among their neighbors. But McCarter mentioned to me in passing that some supporters had gone to Washington, D.C., on January 6. A conservative-leaning separatist movement isn’t definitionally exclusionary or violent, but movements like Greater Idaho can’t be entirely decoupled from the context of menacing and violent right-wing organizing in the region. The Patriot movement, a set of anti-government conspiracist militias, remains active today, and Timber Unity, a rural solidarity group with extremist connections, gives money and support to county-commissioner candidates, including many who go on to win.

&gt; Much of Oregon’s history was “driven by an understanding of violence as a commonplace method of solving problems,” Kittredge, the rancher memoirist, wrote. The Greater Idaho movement’s more avid supporters say Darrow’s idea is the only thing keeping them from an insurrection. 

...

&gt; The first visitor to arrive was a woman wearing a shirt that said be more american who came to yell at McCarter, with her daughter and granddaughter in tow. “Idaho doesn’t want us—I moved out of Idaho for a reason!” she shouted, standing over the table. Her son has seizures and needs medical marijuana, which is legal in Oregon, but not Idaho. (Marijuana came up nearly as often as diesel fuel in my conversations about the border move.) “I’ll still vote for it, though, because of the values,” she said. She shook McCarter’s hand and went to buy a gun at the register. 

...

&gt; Joining Idaho is a “mind-bogglingly oversimplified” notion, Steve Grasty, a retired Harney County judge, told me. Counties such as Harney are hugely dependent on federal funding; Oregon’s second congressional district, which covers the entire eastern swath of the state, was the nation’s biggest recipient of Affordable Care Act funds. But even Grasty, who used to travel to Salem to advocate for the county, admitted that the legislature there didn’t seem interested in the stories and problems he brought from rural Oregon. “Over and over, I worked to put that rural perspective into focus, and it really didn’t get heard.” He could have changed parties, but stayed a Democrat just so people on the west side of the state would talk to him, he told me.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
328,"SOME BACKGROUND OF ME: So I'm a 23 year old college going student and a citizen even though I immigrated here and went through grueling process of becoming an American citizen. Ive grown up in a non-american household in America since I was pretty young. So I see this question from a lot of difference viewpoints. My father and I lean more to the Democratic side while my mother and especially my brother lean towards the Republican side. So this creates for plenty of interesting conversations at dinner and I hear a lot of the opposing side which I actually agree with. 

Listen, I personally don't think America is bad. I mean do we have problems? Fuck yes we do and we need to get out shit together and fix that ASAP. Social issues, gun violence, the economy, etc. Yes these are all issues present in America. But to be quite honest as of right now, there's still not another place I would want to live rn. My parents immigrated here with me to give me a better life and honestly I notice that. People outside America typically see ""white"" America a lot. I would know my parents watch foreign news on YouTube talking about America. International media tends to exaggerate a lot and so does American media on both sides liberal and conservative sometimes. I watch and read from sources on both sides typically cause of the even divide in our family lol. 

It's a matter of actually living in America. You do get desensitized to a lot of horrible things like gun violence and social issues. But that's looking as America as a whole. I think if you live here you'll come to see that your average American isn't what news medias push. It has problems just like ever other country has its deep rooted issues.

&gt;You've answered my concern and not even realized it. We have an extremely porous series of borders in which the drug trade rages unabated. 

Guns don't come from our southern border, drugs do. That's a red herring.

&gt;There is also the fact that it's simply not true that the totality of gun crime issues in Chicago are to be blamed on Indiana. 

https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2019/08/29/dixie-pipeline-guns-from-mississippi-streets-chicago-crime-violence-gangs-trafficking/1898930001/

There's been plenty of studies done on this. Guns aren't manufactured in the inner city of Chicago. They come from neighboring states.

&gt;The prevention of private sales is certainly unconstitutional

This isn't a good conversation if I continue to give evidence of my claims and you don't have to. Nothing is unconstitutional about registration. 

&gt;From what I can gather, you haven't used for firearm in an illegal fashion, so no, it isn't insane

Irrelevant, there's plenty who have.

&gt;And if the private transfer was illegal, there is literally nothing to stop the illegal transfers that still.

&gt;You're asking for laws that restrict the average citizen that won't do anything to stop the criminal offender

Again, illegal guns come mostly from legal purchases. This would not restrict legal, law abiding citizens to own guns. It would however make it much more difficult for those that cannot obtain guns legally",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s a cult of gun ownership with irrational and basically religious beliefs that owning guns make you safer. This is contrary to the objective reality that gun ownership in the US facilitates massive amounts if v violence and suicide.

Despite the hard facts, the clear numbers, Americans are reliably emotional about the FEELING of power/safety by having a gun/guns.

The entire rest of the developed world has faced this illusion and enjoy much lower rates of gun violence and suicide.

We all cling to our preferred illusions. This American dream might feel intoxicating but the cost is terribly high.

When children are routinely murdered by other children at school and there are no law changes of any significance or impact it is a collective indictment of the morals and priorities of not just the elected officials but also collectively of the Americans who give them power.

I know from my experience with abuse that when we feel small, hurt and vulnerable we retreat from rationality and become willing to do almost anything to regain a sense of power and control.

&gt; Gun Violence: We seek a country where school shootings and gun massacres are not commonplace.

the last school shooting here was in 2009

There is no right to bear arms and gun ownership is highly restricted. [About 70 people](http://www.zeit.de/2014/04/waffen-deutschland) die every year in Germany because someone shot them with a firearm. Germany has a population of [83,155,031](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online?operation=abruftabelleBearbeiten&amp;levelindex=1&amp;levelid=1626364663542&amp;auswahloperation=abruftabelleAuspraegungAuswaehlen&amp;auswahlverzeichnis=ordnungsstruktur&amp;auswahlziel=werteabruf&amp;code=12411-0001&amp;auswahltext=&amp;werteabruf=starten#abreadcrumb*), therefore the rate is 0.84 deaths per 1 million inhabitants per year.

[19,401 people](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls) in the US were murdered with a firearm in 2020. Given the population of [331,449,281](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/2020-census-data-release.html), the rate was 58.5 deaths per 1 million inhabitants per year.

That means: By moving from the US to Germany you reduce your likelihood of dying because someone shot you by 98.5%. 

In other words: Your likelihood to get murdered with a gun if you live in Germany for 1 year is the same as if you live in the US for 5 days and 6 hours.

&gt; Homelessness

Every poor citizen gets social welfare for an unlimited time. The government pays for an apartment, for heating costs, for health care and for a single person an additional 446 euro ? $504 per month for their other expenses, for a family with three kids 1,669 euro ? $2000 

&gt; Substance Use Crisis

there is no such crisis in Germany. 

Germany has [about 1,500 overdose deaths per year](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/403/umfrage/todesfaelle-durch-den-konsum-illegaler-drogen/) = 18 per million inhabitants. The US had 100,306 overdose deaths in the last year = 304 per million inhabitants = the problem in the US is 17x as bad as in Germany.

&gt; Permanent Residency: Our number one criteria is a relatively straightforward path to permanent residency. If your country has a pathway that we qualify for please post the name of your country and the method

The name of my country is Germany and the first step is to get a visa. The first one of you will 

- get a work visa when they have an offer for a job that is connected to their degree: https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa-residence/types/work-qualified-professionals

- get a student visa when they study in Germany, for example for a tuition-free English-taught degree: https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/how-to-study

As soon as the first of you has a visa, the second one of you will then get a dependant visa as the spouse. The visa allows the second one to work whatever they want. 

The second step is permanent residency, which you will get under the current law:

- after 21 months with a job that is connected to your degree and pays 44,304 euro in the fields of mathematics, IT, natural sciences, engineering and human medicine or 56,800 euro in other fields if you speak German level B1

- after 33 months with such a job if you speak German level A1

- after 4 years with a job that is connected to your degree if you speak German level B1 (with no income threshold)

- after 2 years with a job that is connected to your degree if you first study and graduate in Germany

- after 5 years as the spouse if none of the above categories apply to them

The new government that came into office this week has announced to shorten the time to permanent residency to a maximum of 3 years: https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/r23pdg/news_germany_new_coalition_plans_to_introduce_new/

The third step is to get citizenship which is currently possible after 6-8 years. The new government has announced to shorten it to 3-5 years.

&gt; If your country meets any of our criteria(s), please specify which criteria(s) it meets. 

I think Germany meets pretty much all of the criteria other than that our primary business language is not English.

&gt; If it does not meet our criteria(s) please specify why not.

When German-speaking people from Anglia (northern Germany) and Saxony (Eastern Germany) invaded Britain and became known as Anglo-Saxons they brought their language with them but that is now 1,500 years ago so the German they spoke over there and the German we speak here have since developed into different languages. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_English

&gt; Explanations of cultural values 

that is a bit too broad, can you narrow it down a bit? 

&gt; attitudes towards American immigrants would be very helpful

Many Germans do not like US politics for all the reasons you have listed but that does not translate to attitudes towards individual Americans ... other than those who think and proudly tell everyone they meet that America is an exceptional, number 1 country worldwide, that German people are slaves to their government because we have no second amendment, that German hate speech laws are an unjust censorship of our free speech and so on.

337,"&gt;        Pretty much all of the ones south of the US

Which countries in Central or South America have strong gun regulation that are well enforced?

&gt;        Brazil for example.

First of all, one developing country does not discount the fact that the USA compares very poorly to every other developed country when it comes to rates of gun related injuries and deaths. It’s quite the trick to complain that I’m ignoring one or a few countries, meanwhile you are ignoring dozens that are more comparable.

Comparing with other developed countries is not arbitrary because of the significant differences this tends to imply. In particular rates of poverty, corruption and crime tend to be higher due to socioeconomic issues. This is exactly the case in much of Brazil, along with a terrible reputation for its [law enforcement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Brazil) and prisons (not unlike the USA in that regard). I also would not characterise the country as having particularly strong gun regulations, yes there are some laws such as requiring registration but they are poorly enforced, going by the high estimates of unregistered guns and are not accompanied by measures to reduce this such as gun buyback programs.

&gt;        There you go again, restricting yourself to an arbitrary limit of “developed nations” saying “look those laws work here so they must work in the US” and blatantly ignoring instances where they don’t work at all because those instances don’t fit your arbitrary limits.

It’s not arbitrary at all. Do you think if we were comparing for instance, rates of literacy by country and the US ranked low compared with other developed countries this could be excused by saying: “well literacy rates are worse in Brazil”?

&gt;        No it’s not, the origins of our country as a country having to fight for our freedoms, having to fight to even get to these lands and there are still people fighting to get here to this day. 

The US is far from unique for having to “fight for our freedoms” or because people who want to immigrate there, honestly this is basically just American propaganda.

&gt;Europe may have immigrants, but the US is nothing but immigrants

I’m surprised to have to inform you that the USA actually *do* have an indigenous population, sometimes known as *Native* Americans. You might be interested in learning about the historical and ongoing [injustices the USA have done to these communities](https://youtu.be/euf-EQ8udYw)

&gt;        There’s plenty of difference.

I didn’t say there aren’t other differences, I said it was the most *important* cultural difference. You still haven’t explained what your point is besides saying “we’re different”. Moreover, you are undermining your own argument — why are you happy to compare with Brazil then, are they not culturally different from the US or what?

&gt;        As for some it's cars

To drive a car people are required to have training, a license in date, their car registered, maintained regularly to meet standards, and insurance. For certain classes of vehicle, especially larger ones which may carry more passengers or weight and so can be more dangerous the requirements are higher still. Would you be willing to consider similar regulations for firearms?

&gt;or the LGBT movement

Right, because liking guns to the point of posting pictures of yourself with guns on social media is *exactly* like sexual orientation or gender identity /s.

&gt;that's just how some people are, what's your point?

My point is that many of these gun enthusiasts feel personally attacked at the slightest mention of discussing *any* gun regulation, because it is so central to their identity (combined with propaganda from groups like the NRA). They’re literally up in arms about it despite the problems including mass and school shootings in the country. Lawmakers get death threats for daring to even discuss this.

If you take this to mean I think it’s wrong to enjoy shooting or owning a gun, you have misunderstood me. It’s combined with the reluctance to acknowledge the problems and even consider possible solutions that I take issue with. As I said elsewhere:

It’s also possible to have much better regulation, less guns overall, and lower gun violence while still permitting people to shoot recreationally, or for certain needs. This is not a binary issue where the only options are the status quo and banning the use of firearms completely.

&gt;        It would if it means that there would be mass noncompliance from millions of people, nit to mention there are tens of millions of people that activly don't want it.

Want what? We haven’t discussed a single potential gun regulation yet and you’re already imagining a disastrous outcome for no reason. Similar safety regulations met with initial resistance have happened in other industries, like transportation and tobacco, gradually over time. Gun regulation and buybacks specifically have worked fairly recently in other countries like Australia and New Zealand, it would definitely be more difficult in the US but there are plenty of successful models.

&gt;        You also said they wouldn’t need to be armed, or at least that was the goal.

Not *all* police (eg the UK have armed police but only in rare circumstances that they are needed) and not all at once but gradually.

&gt;        And this is somehow becsuse of guns and not becauee of government overreach, racism, and senseless government spending waste? Seems like you’re missing the target there chief.

Not entirely, I don’t know where you got that idea. I definitely agree there are other factors, possibly even more significant ones (eg systemic racism). But I absolutely do think that high rates of police brutality and especially shootings are related to high rates of firearms (among both police and the population) and gun violence.

Again, what would prevent the US from having stronger gun regulations as well as police reform?",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I mean, we’ve been shattering records for number of guns owned, new gun purchases, **AND** new gun owners every month for going on **23 CONSECUTIVE months.**. That’s no small feat.  

But despite those 23 record shattering months (with no slowing down in sight), the US has been on a steady downward trend for violent crime for the last few decades.  If gun violence were really that bad — with our over 400,000,000 known firearms and over 160,000,000 gun owners — our violent crime rates should be skyrocketing instead of continually declining.

Then you have the fact that people use firearms in self-defense more than 6x more often than they’re used in homicides, and that’s according to the lowest estimates formerly quoted by the Brady Campaign stats (NCVS; CDC).

If anything should cheer you up, it’s that.  But if it doesn’t, all you’d need to do is name a personal defensive tool that’s equal to a firearm in every regard without the possibility of being misused so that firearms are obsolete.

Narcissism is technically a mental illness, too. Are you going to excuse the behavior of the woman in the OP because she had a mental illness? There are countries in Europe where every adult is required to have a gun, that are objectively more egalitarian than the US, and yet have virtually no gun rampages.

&gt;As far as going on murderous rampage is concerned, 100 times more muslims have done 'murderous rampages' in last 2 decades itself, than incels.  

You would be wrong, unless you’re counting 9/11, and those guys were after their 99 virgins. 

&gt;Nobody calls for ban on islam. 

Hahahhahahahhahahha
Dude.  You must not be American. 

&gt;There is clear evidence than incels who did mass-murder did it on their own. 

There is clear evidence that they were egged in by online communities of men.  That’s why r/incels was banned. Other subreddits have been banned or quarantined after members who were active there, and who posted violent thoughts to applause there, went on rampages. There were men posting every day with fantasies about giving the women who denied them sex ‘their comeuppance.’

€If your logic stands correct, we should ban islam too. Isn't it?

Given how many ‘Christian Patriots’ are now openly advocating for shooting all of the liberals and enslaving ‘their’ women in America, I’m a fuckton more afraid of them right now. We’re on the brink of a civil war over here, in part due to religions cultists who want to impose their religious laws on the rest of us. It’s not Muslims, though. Still, I don’t think ‘ban’ is the right word for them, or for incels, or for fundie Muslims. I definitely think it’s a good idea to shut down echo chambers of any type, Muslim, Christian, incel, or feminist, that advocate violence.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It happens in the wealthy suburbs because the police won't arrest the little shits in the burbs.

This is a true statement, but is not a rebuttal to my comment above. [60% of all mass shootings use semi-automatic *handguns](https://everytownresearch.org/maps/mass-shootings-in-america-2009-2019/).* it’s not just “assault weapons” that come in semi-automatic. In fact, you have to go out of your way to purchase a handgun that *isn't* semi-automatic as only revolvers and single-shot handguns qualify.  
  
&gt; Weird how some people think new gun laws or gun control will result in 'elimination' of gun violence   
  
This is a straw man argument. I don’t ask that you prevent all crime with a single law. I do ask that when you use a tragedy to push a law that the law would have had some sort of effect on the crime had it been in place. For instance, the example above. An assault weapon ban wouldn’t have had an effect on this crime as a handgun was used. So, back to the question above, since this crime is being used in a renewed push for gun control, what laws can we pass that might have prevented this tragedy?",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, the study found that “a 10 unit increase in state gun law permissiveness was associated with a significant 11.5 higher rate of mass shootings.”

Research conducted by Louis Klarevas of Teachers College, Columbia University, for his book Rampage Nation: Securing America from Mass Shootings found that during the 10-year period that the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 was in effect (September 13, 1994-September 12, 2004), the United States experienced a 37 percent decrease in high-fatality mass shooting incidents and a 43% decrease in high-fatality mass shooting deaths, in comparison to the 10-year period immediately preceding the federal ban. Immediately following the federal ban’s expiration, the U.S. experienced a 183 percent increase in high-fatality mass shooting incidents and a 239 percent increase in high-fatality mass shooting deaths.

The problem is the higher-ups, e.g. the police chiefs and others in places of power in the police state, they are the racists who don't fire bad cops and make propaganda training that gives the racists they inadvertently hired a reason to be racist with a badge and gun.

But the average cop on the street? Not a racist. Probably not even that concerned with anything other than enforcing the law.

Now, most of the laws he enforces are bad. But he' himself, is just doing his job and probably agrees with 80% of America that if there's a law out there it is for people's safety.

It's not like most cops are following us around with a gun drawn and badge ready, just waiting to pull us over for the smallest infraction on the planet.

Every news source tells the same story a different way, and I dont care enough about issues to bother fact checking to stay informed. Like the Rittenhouse case. In the end I really dont care what the outcome was because I trust that they had a legitimate reason for the verdict. No matter what the system is fucked and my intervention won't change that. I don't know what side would benefit america more in the long run so why should I even vote? Its another reason I don't trust in the idea of the common man voting. Look at all the conspiracy nuts. Some of the things these people believe are ridiculous, and they get to influence our country even if they are misinformed. Or on the other side, I'm being told to change how I think because a guy feels feminine enough he wants to dress as a girl and go into the girls bathroom, and if it doesn't seem right to me I'm a bigot. 

Both sides are full of dumbasses so to me society is fucked either way. I'm just a common white guy, only 23 but why would I want to support a side that vilifies me just for being white?

This is complete speculation, far more than anything else we've discussed.

You know who's actions we know for sure got someone killed? Rittenhouse's. He didn't improve the situation, he didn't make anyone safer, he literally showed up to antagonize and escalate. 

The legal mechanics of the situation allow him to avoid the charge of murder, but he absolutely created a situation on purpose that lead to deaths. 

It's another Trayvon Martin situation. In America it's entirely possible to force yourself into a situation where you can justifiably (in the eyes of the law) kill someone as long as you're not too discriminate about who you're killing. Just keep pushing and making stupider and stupider decisions until you have no other choice than to kill another person to protect yourself from the consequences of your own actions. 

Which is why people are so upset about it. This kind of shit is going to continue to get worse if something isn't done about it. It's a miracle it hasn't happened more already, and that's exclusively thanks to the vast majority of leftists committing to non-violence. Every one of those trucks of armed white supremacists driving around protests and demonstrations is just waiting to feel threatened enough to kill someone. All those people in their cars driving through protest zones waiting to feel threatened enough to gun it and plow down a bunch of people. Even the cops drive around shooting less lethal rounds willy nilly just waiting for someone to respond so they can pull out the lead.

When you have no duty to retreat, to not be lethally armed, or even try to de-escalate according to the law then these situations are only going to get worse.

I’d go with my kid and help people, if a crazed child rapist attacked my kid i’d hope he had a gun to defend himself as i’d hope my daughter would if she walked home alone late at night. It’s clear you don’t believe in the right to self defence so all of America and me have lost respect for you.

Which supports my point so….i was right.

Are you an idiot? The police STOOD BY and did nothing, saying you saw a cop doing nothing supports my point again. Fuck me you’re thick. Besides, when Rittenhouse was attacked by the child rapist, the skateboard guy and the guy with a gun he was walking towards the police and went to the police as soon as he was able to get away from the assaulting rioters. What point are you even making here? None of the evidence supports your views at all.

So unprovable racist cops didn’t abandon black owned businesses during the riot so kyle didn’t need the gun for self defence that he only used in self defence. That’s your argument? Fucking hell that’s so contradictory and stupid.

He had the right to protect his life and his community, kinda the second biggest right in America you idiot. You think it’s ok for asians to defend their businesses, some were just friends of the owners like Rittenhouse, but when a white guy does it you say he’s a psycho mass shooter wannabe with intent to harm even though all evidence points to self defence. You’re being weird here *bro*

Move the goal post much? He was defending the community with his friends and was asked by Sal the owner of a dealership to be there. Why would he need to specifically work at the place that was on fire to want to help put it out? Why does he have to be with his dad to prove he is part of the community? His dad lives there. Nice try at being completely disingenuous though as your “state lines” argument falls apart. Had you watched the trial you’d know this argument was poor when the prosecution didn’t make it.

And there it is “riot ok, kid stopping riot bad” you’re a complete idiot. Also, you said the police didn’t abandon them yet you say “you can’t control a hive mind” so admit the police could do nothing anyway then you blame Rittenhouse house for trying just because he’s 17? Your logic is literally insane and makes no sense, stop trying to be right just use your fucking brain to think for 5 seconds. 

Cleaning graffiti and putting out fires is community service. The gun was for self defence and is completely legal to do so, the only issue is a few months before Rittenhouse was old enough to do it legally, which is pretty “oh well technically” talk considering and child rapist attacked him with two other people, one of which had a gun. 

Yeah, the rioters were also foolish and unwise. I’m defending the guy who, perhaps foolishly and unwisely, tried to help end the arson, the rioting, the violence and give medical aid instead of defending child rapists and rioters who attacked a kid. Your argument is like blaming women for being raped because they were in the wrong neighbourhood, which is foolish and unwise right? God your ability to understand basic fallacies and poor arguments astounding.

So because there’s no medals or recognition, trying to stop a riot or help those hurt by it is pointless? Says a lot about how you think, ever think Rittenhouse did it just because it was the right thing to do?

371,"&gt;It's pretty obvious that if you remove guns from an area it will reduce deaths and violent crime committed with that specific tool, but it doesn't reduce the total amount of deaths or violent crime committed.

Okay, so the [top ten states by total violent crime](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/01/13/most-dangerous-states-in-america-violent-crime-murder-rate/40968963/) are Alaska (F), New Mexico (C+), Tennessee (D-), Arkansas (F), Nevada (C+), Louisiana (F), Alabama (F), Missouri (F), South Carolina (F), and Arizona (F).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If everyone was armed and trained, the first person to witness a shooting would challenge the shooter to stand down. If the shoot was lawful, the shooter would stand down. If they didn't stand down, they would be shot. There wouldn't be confusion because we would be working together as a community to stop the violence instead of relying on others too.

This is delusional. This would not work in real world situations, in big population centers or crowded areas, where would be no time to coordinate ""as a community"", whatever the fuck that means. Have you lived in a city?

Also, if two people are pointing their guns at each other, who is acting in self defense? Who stands down when they each tell each other?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;People that don't follow laws to acquire guns already have guns.

Yeah, because the US has ridiculously lax gun regulation. The solution to this isn't making it easier to get guns.

Plenty of people are deterred from buying guns due to common-sense gun laws. Even just implementing waiting periods lowers suicide rates.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If the rest of society decided they wanted to actively route out the criminal culture by the same means the criminals are willing to attack them we would live in a much different world.

Yeah, we would live in a much different world. Not a better one though. Show me a country where this worked on a large scale.

I'm aware of gun violence in America. I'm also well aware of the vast majority of violent crime involving gangs and cartels. The 10 most dangerous cities in the world are all in Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela. All those cartels make most their money illegally smuggling people, drugs, and weapons into the US and committing more crimes here. It's far closer with hundreds of millions more people than Canada or the UK which makes it a much better target for cartels to deal in. The cartels have slowly been building networks in Europe though. So we'll see what it looks like in a couple decades with them more ingrained over there as well.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

374,"Sorry, let me clarify.  I am not asserting the gun malfunctioned.

I am trying to make an analogy.  We protect negligent or careless people in our society by placing the burden on often a guiltless party - the manufacturer.  Power tools today must have safety features which protect the user even against his own negligence sometimes.  It is not necessarily a matter of whose fault it is, it is a matter of how to allocate burden that is efficient.  One change by the manufacturer beats every user being hyper careful.

The way this relates to this case is that I agree that the Rosenbaums of the world are idiots.  And I also realize that there are probably way too many guns in America to take them away from anyone.  But if you could snap your fingers and remove all guns from society, would things be better?  Sure, some people would not be in a position to defend themselves.  But I think the overall impact is there would be so much less gun violence that society would be benefitted substantially by this change.

There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:

• 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)

• 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 489 (2%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location:

298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)

327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)

328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)

764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)

That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.

This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)

You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)

Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14

Page 15:

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.

Older study, 1995:

https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;context=jclc

Page 164

The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.

r/dgu is a great sub to pay attention to, when you want to know whether or not someone is defensively using a gun

The [likelihood of dying in the U.S. by gun is about the same as dying in a car crash](https://time.com/5476998/risk-of-guns-america/). There are certain situations and environments that are not safe to live in due to threats of violence, so gun ownership is necessary: Owning a home (you might be robbed and need something to defend yourself), living in a neighborhood of high crime, traveling to an area of large crowds or potential unrest, going into a gas station late at night, etc.

The reality is though, most people don't live in bad areas where they absolutely need to carry all the time. These stats are inflated due to clusters of high crime, poverty stricken areas in highly populated cities across the U.S. Most people don't face threats of high crime on a daily basis, they are just a statistical anomaly that makes the local news in most cases.

&amp;#x200B;

A high school basketball game is NOT a place to bring a gun. I don't care where you are coming from or what you are doing, if you are not a trained professional with proper reasons to carry, then you should not have a gun at a SCHOOL. . . . (PERIOD)

When people carry a gun into walmart, they believe that they are protecting themselves the same as they would wear a seatbelt in a car. You likely won't be in a wreck, but it's just not worth the risk of dying in one. The reality is, the comparison is more like being able to swim but always wearing floaties in the pool. You know you aren't in any danger or trouble, but you just don't want to take the risk of drowning.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all for gun ownership, but as it is the regulations are not enough for owning a weapon that can end someone's life quicker than the blink of an eye.

380,"Full disclosure for transparency's sake: I am a 2nd amendment supporter. It exists not for self protection but for the overthrow of tyrannical governments. This is a 100% orthodox reading of the right as defined numerous times by the supreme court.

Now, I say this because I want you to understand the context of what I mean when I say we don't have a gun problem in America, and I'm 100% aware of how suspicious those words are coming from a person like me. 

We have a mental illness problem, a white supremacist problem, and a diseased culture problem in America. Parents who think they're dictators in their own home, or who simply aren't involved at all in their childrens' lives caused this. Gun owners who never owned the PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IMPLICIT TO ANY AND EVERY LIBERTY caused this when they didn't secure their weapons appropriately. (As a gun owner, I can tell you nothing pisses me off more than other gun owners...) Our nation's failure to implement a socially funded mental health care industry that EVERYONE has access to caused this. You have to go to a goddamn dentist in this country to get into middle school, but there are ZERO psychological screenings at various points in our lives to identify and treat avoidable psychological illness. We let our children get assaulted, libeled and abused in our derelict school systems to the point they break and do something heinous. 

None of these are the fault of firearms. These are SOCIETAL failings. 

To add to my point, while it is true the US has the most guns per capita of all western states, we're not the ONLY western state with high guns per capita. What we are is the ONLY western nation with high guns per capita that has the absolutely out of control gun violence that we do. You have to go to tyrannical failed states under theocratic control to find similar rates of gun violence. What this says is that it's NOT the amount or ease of access to guns that causes this. Again, other western states have easy access and high rates of gun ownership, but they have orders of magnitude less violence. If guns = violence, then we should see a statistical trend between the two metrics, and we don't. 

We've allowed the US to become a cesspool of bad ideas and people who just don't give a _FUCK_ about each other. I blame this primarily on conservatism and a virulent, aggressive form of Christianity, but that's ultimately a different conversation.

The point is, if you want school violence to end, you have to treat the PROBLEM, not the symptom. Guns didn't cause this. If you remove them, you neuter your god given rights and set the precedent that ANY right can be removed because ""reasons"" down the line and that's NOT a path you want to take. You must deal with poverty, healthcare, mental health services...you must create a society that RESPECTS mankind above profits and corporations. 

We don't have that. So we're going to have more and more violence. I PROMISE you, implementing UBI will do more to address gun violence than all the proposed bans in the world ever could.

Like I said, guns are designed to be a ranged weapon. Weapons are defined as something that can cause bodily harm. Killing is an intent that can only be attributed to a person.

Which is why people don't care much about it on the news.

388,"There are a couple levels to this:

First, America is in a great cultural divide between two primary camps. The first is the traditional, pro-Freedom group. This group believes in the traditional American mindset of the government should leave people alone if they’re not hurting anyone. To people in this camp, gun rights are just a fraction of the liberty which are critical to preserve, the others including but not limited to: free speech, parental rights, economic freedom, right to choose healthcare, and right to defense, freedom from
Surveillance/deep state police. The other side of this debate is the left-wing authoritarian side. Even if they were not opposed to gun rights (which they must be in order to achieve their authoritarian ends), the pro-freedom side would still be aghast at their opposition to free speech, parental rights, economic freedom, right to choose healthcare, and blatant support of political violence an opposition to your right to self defense, and support of weaponizing the deep state against the American people. Generally speaking, all the pro-freedom politicians line up on the Republican side and all the left-wing authoritarians line up on the Democrat side (there are exceptions to the rule of course), hence the strong dislike for those who vote Democrat.

The second part of this is that Democrat politicians fight to take gun rights away while Republican politicians generally do not. Some Republicans do vote in favor of massive omnibus bills (bills that are not a single idea but a massive wish list of various different things. It’s scum my politics here) Democrats generally bring up 3 arguments agains this idea, but all are flawed. First, they bring up Ronald Reagan implemented gun control. However, what happened in a party’s distant history does not have bearing on what the parties are doing today. Second, that Obama never passes gun control. The fact is he couldn’t do anything for 6 of the 8 years he was president because he didn’t have control of Congress and the Presidency. And in those 2 years he did, the country was focused on recovering from the Great Recession, not gun control. The 3rd is that during the Trump Administration, the ATF changed their position on bump stocks from legal to illegal. This was done through the bureaucratic state (virtually all Democrats) at the behest of a single politician who wasn’t even a Republican 4 years prior. This is an indictment of the unconstitutional power invested in the executive branch not Republican Party at large. To the contrary, in recent years, we have seen Republican state governments across the country continue to pass more and more pro-2A legislation while no such examples exist in Democrat controlled states.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A hunter's safety course and stop the bleed component should also be included. Any range that offers this course gets a tax rebate per person who takes the class. Americans should be familiar with gun safety, we have more guns than people in our country. Hopefully this also helps some people realize that they are not magical murder machines, and others that they are not a magical talisman that gets you women and makes your dick hard.

2) National grants given to every county/municipality for the creation and maintenance of a public gun range that is free to use. They can be privately contracted out so long as they offer the course above and remain free for anyone to use. They can offer private classes/firearm rentals/ammo sales etc to help fund themselves as well, but must maintain equal accomodations. This helps facilitate point 1.

3) Raise the Federal age to purchase ANY firearm to 21 years for anyone who has not attended the class in point 1. Attending the class gets you access to firearms at age 18. I believe this would motivate most municipalities to set up the classes and ranges quickly and get people to attend them with minimal complaint.

4) Residents of the USA who sign up for their selective service (which will now be gender/disability neutral) are registered to vote automatically and cannot be purged from voter rolls without a felony conviction or a valid death certificate.

4a) I have a whole theory about how we can establish a voluntary service corps based around jobs training, community service, and rolling teach for America under the same umbrella. This two year service period would be gender and ability blind. Service would get you access to the GI bill to fund your education or vocational training, as well as allow you access to enter the military as a commissioned officer. That's less firearms related, but might help close the education gap for disadvantaged communities while directing federal resources into those communities at the same time.

5) Universal healthcare, including mental health, available to everyone in the US regardless of legal status. Either through Medicare for all, the establishment of a National Health Service, or some other method. We need to destigmatize mental healthcare for young men especially.

6) End the war on drugs. Prohibition does not work, and addiction is a disease. Treat it like one. Moreover, reducing financial incentives for gang and street level violence will be beneficial to the public as a whole and reduce ""gun crime"". Commute the sentences of all current drug felons, and give them full pardons on all non-violent drug convictions.

7) Open the NICS background check system to everyone as a free service available via mobile app. This is strictly a ""Go/No Go"" system without a detailed report. This can be autogenerated with a QR code link so that the ""buyer"" initiates the background check in real time without giving private information to the seller such as SS number, etc. There is no reason for a private sale to go forward without a background check if the system is free and easy to use. This closes the ""gun show/truck bed"" loophole.

8) Raise the minimum wage to a living wage, and get people out of poverty. Alternatively, use a universal basic income system to give people a baseline quality of life. Start with Yang's UBI proposal paid for with a VAT and tune it to the American economy. Systematic inequality kills more people every year than guns do.

9) Remove silencers and SBR/SBS from the NFA. No more extra taxes for cosmetic features and shortened barrels. Suppressors have valid legal uses such as hunting and preventing hearing loss. This law only restricts these items to the wealthy, and serves no public safety function. This is a prime example of how ""gun control"" is classist.

10) Non-violent felons will have their voting and gun rights returned to them upon the completion of the sentences. Either the rehabilitation system works or it doesn't, and we all know that it doesn't. Major prison and sentencing reforms need to occur, starting with removing the judicial slavery clause from the 13th Amendment.

11) National concealed carry reciprocity. We already do this for driver's licenses. I cross three state borders for work each week, and where/how/when I am able to carry should depend on my proficiency and ability to pass a background check/training course within accordance with my home state's laws and regulations.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

398,"What happened to you was horrific and I am so sorry. 

I devoutly believe in the concept of reform. I think that locking up criminals is a waste of society resources because we are immersing them in a bath of criminality and violence and then either never letting them go or releasing this new concentrated criminal.

I think that, especially in America, we are far too quick to declare that reform is possible without ever even trying.

The people who are defending the 14 year old rapists are wrong for two big reasons.

Knowing these kinds of people, they are fine locking up a 14 year old black boy for having weed, or carrying a gun. They are often taking about locking the jails and throwing away the keys. So when they say ""don't ruin the rapists life"" they don't come from a place of pro-reform but from a place of pro-rape.

The other concern is what you said when He put You in prison. It's really hard to justify the criminal suffering less than the victim. We instinctually want the criminal to suffer more. While I think that we need to purge our society of the retributive impulse, that doesn't make your hurt go away. At a minimum society should invest at least as much in YOUR rehabilitation as they do in the rehabilitation of the criminal. I do think there is a world where victim and criminal can both come ot the other end healthy but we currently prioritize neither of these.

So, this dude, and everyone defending people like him, deserve to be thrown in a hole forever. I wish though we had the will and the resources to term criminal justice from a punishment into a healing force.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

401,"Does this change your mind? I would be interested to see some of your data as well to support your statement from before about going to war

To start, America ranks 10th out of DEVELOPED nations for highest chance of dying in a mass shooting, and 111th overall. Even then, your chance of dying in one of these events is less than you being struck and killed by lightning... twice

https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mass-shootings-by-country/

To continue, lets find out how mass shootings are defined in the US versus every other Country. The official number used to require 6 deaths or more - this was lowered to 4 INJURIES or more to push the narrative that they're far more common. This definition would be totally fine if it weren't for the fact that anti-gun websites misrepresent this number by including gang shootouts, drug deals gone bad, etc. They've even been caught going as far as Including airsoft and BB guns

https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/shootingtracker-com-uses-pellet-guns-to-boost-mass-shooting-numbers/

This is all without even getting into the fact that ANY discharge of a firearm on school grounds automatically counts as a school shooting, which also constitutes a mass shooting. Let's say someone has an accidental discharge and they live in a school zone - mass shooting. Let's say someone commits suicide at midnight on a Saturday - mass shooting.

The US is the only place with funky rules like this, and even with them, we're not even close to the top spot

AR-15's are the main firearm discussed by the left, so I'll be addressing that next. ALL TYPES of rifles together killed 297 people last year, and that's ANY instance in which it was used - whether that be lawful, such as home defense - or criminal such as gang activity, mass shootings, etc.

Fists and feet killed 700.

Knives killed 1,500.

Guns aren't the problem, especially rifles

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls

There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:

• 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)

• 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 489 (2%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location:

298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)

327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)

328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)

764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)

That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.

This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10) You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11) Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#15

Page 15:

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including suicides. (Which account for over 75% of all deaths by gun

Older study, 1995:

https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;context=jclc

Page 164

The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.

402,"Let me address the guns by pasting my response to someone else:

That my friend, is a very complex topic. America qas forged in war, like many nations, however guns were super intertwined with us from the beginning. We had an infamously toxic relationship with the natives, and back in the day guns were a necessity with both sides committing horrible atrocities to each other, combined with the several armed conflicts we had to fight against European and Middle Eastern powers in self defense, and the many dangerous predators, there were too many threats NOT to have guns. And that isn't even mentioning the pragmatic purposes, like hunting. This foundational ingrainment I believe (though I am NOT an expert) is responsible for our love of firearms today. Now why is it a horrible idea to get rid of them?

Skip ahead to the 1920s, a pretty infamous event (at least over here in the States) occured known as prohibition. Essentially a bunch of angry housewives strongarmed the US government into banning alcohol. Keep in mind, alcohol is NOT a constitutional right, meaning it isn't considered inherent to all human beings here. This ban, even without being a constitutional right, drove the country into an intense period of violence and organized crime (you may have heard of Al Capone?). 

Imagine being told your whole life that you have certain rights that can never be taken away from you. Right to free speech, press,  and religion, right to gather, protest, and bear arms, etc. Well, nkw imagine the government took one of these rights away. Well now they've touched our unalienable rights illegally. There's a reason the constitution is such a big deal in the US, it's above everyone. Even the president. It says we can bear arms, and the government cannot legally stop us. If they do, then it's tyranny from the American perspective. Whether or not intense gun control is a good idea practically speaking or not, it sets a very dangerous president in America. That the government can ignore the Supreme law of the land, and infringe on our basic human rights.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All returned guns can be recycled or stored where they can't be stolen. Once everyone's or the majority of people have given up guns, make the lower level police officers give up their guns. Only the military gets to keep guns.

Either that or somehow mentally condition police officers that they're servants to the civilians, and have to behave. This however isn't an America problem, I'm sure cops in most countries have their heads up their asses and have a superiority complex.

That means 89.92% of homicides are gun-related in the US. For comparison’s sake, in the UK the gun-related homicide rate is 0.02 people per 100,000 and the overall homicide rate is 1.20 people per 100,000.

Duterte is a dictator. Just like Biden. I agree.

Not saying Trump didn't say some stupid things, but many were taken out of context and many complete lies. 
Yes he should've pardoned Assange and Snowden. I disagree with those comments, although they were 8-10 yrs ago. Obama never pardoned them either, nor Biden. 

Yes, the Patriot act should be recinded. It's now  being used to spy on your political opponent, like Clinton did to Trump, and like Biden is doing to anybody pro-Trump now. 

Trump was the first POTUS to be tough on China. Tariffs were killing them &amp; product manufacturing was switching to the USA. Then China released the Coronavirus as retribution.

The most important issue at this present time is the Covid-19 vaccine mandates. Biden put this forth. Not Trump. 

I will say that recently the MAGA voters have been leading Trump on this issue instead of him leading them. He doesn't realize that many, even non-MAGA voters are against the mandates. Many in the black community are against it too.

Although I think technically, I definitely misspoke, because I personally would consider forced prison labor to 100% be slavery - the Constitution references it as such. and you’re 100% correct, I was thinking those exact things when I typed what I typed, which is why I specified traditional slavery. 

“There are definitely people today who are poor because of slavery.” - I don’t disagree. Slavery is why their family started poor, racism and classism have made sure they stayed there.

I don’t think “benefit” is mutually exclusive from cost, but I certainly wouldn’t posit that “black Americans benefit from slavery” as an independent statement; it’s overly simplistic without context. My point was that the entire system is a product of racism. When people say that “[all] white people benefit from the legacy of slavery”, I think they’re conflating systemic racism and slavery, and they’re confusing “privilege” with “not being oppressed”. The obstacles society places before black Americans are perhaps echoes of slavery, but many of those obstacles also impact other racial minorities, and SOME even impact poor white people because the cause is more classism-related than slavery-related (for some issues). High crime, gun violence and illicit drug use in impoverished communities? That’s a poverty issue, not a race issue (even though Republicans and Democrats both try to simplify it as such). Poor access to quality education and funding resulting in poorer outcomes for youth in terms of secondary education and future employment and upward mobility? A poverty issue. Some of these issues are and have of course been historically exacerbated by systemic racism, like in the form of targeted legislation or even clandestine plots by Nixon and others, and that is still absolutely a factor. Racism is the amplifier but not the root cause of some of these issues. But racial minorities, or specifically black Americans, being oppressed is not the same as white Americans living off a legacy of slavery - not being harmed by slavery directly isn’t a gift, it’s the default state. Nobody should be being oppressed.

Slavery made the rich richer and theoretically made some goods cheaper for the average American, and Jim Crow laws extended that into the modern era so that, with the economic boom from wars wom, an America running on abused laborers could afford to artificially provide the “American Dream” to whites who maybe otherwise wouldn’t have had it so good if black laborers had been paid fair wages, or had they had to compete for jobs with black Americans. And for sure, that improved quality of life for the upper crust and did have a generational benefit for many white Americans… for a while. The Silent Generation and Boomer generations saw the progress of the Civil Rights Movement while simultaneously destroying this nation from the inside to the point that much of those artificial boons for white Americans are just no longer available to anyone except the top of the economic ladder. They were the last to really experience that. They’re still around, and still benefiting, but it will mostly die with them. The Gen-x (some of them), Millenials, Gen-Z - many of those white Americans have what they have because of high interest-rate loans, and credit card debt. For those who grew up in upper middle class homes, they still have the residual head-start they get because of minorities having been strategically economically depressed for the past century. But even being white doesn’t help the poor and most lower middle class people anymore. Outcomes and upward mobility aren’t much better for them against minorities of the same economic means. It’s dying, but not for the right reasons necessarily. While civil rights progress has meant that more possibilities are open to racial minorities,  the American caste system when from being primarily based on race to being primarily based on economic class; this still adversely impacts racial minorities while also impacting a large portion of white Americans. Possibly for the better, since this was probably necessary to get whites more invested in the issue of classism.

The only reason I didn’t grow up in a trailer park and drift off to the lullaby of gunshots is because my dad was in the military and the GI bill enabled him to get a house he wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford, and Veteran’s Preference got him a job he wouldn’t have otherwise qualified for. When I was in high school my parents had 3 kids, made $40,000 before taxes between the two of them and both commuted 100 miles a day, and had over $50,000 in loans (not including mortgage) and credit card debt. Neither has a degree. Both of their fathers retired with pensions, had no degrees, and bought their houses for under $50,000. Their grandparents had no degrees and half of them came from Europe around 1900. Me and my brothers didn’t go to college, didn’t get cars as teens, didn’t get cellphones, didn’t have birthday parties, barely had Christmas and birthday presents, didn’t get allowance, didn’t have friends over because we couldn’t afford snacks. I grew up having a lot of PB&amp;J, tuna, and mac n’ cheese or hot dogs for dinner, corn flakes more rarely. Only went to the doctor for a yearly check up and went to school nauseated and feverish because childcare is expensive and work sick-days were limited for my parents. I once had to loan my mom $150 I’d saved for two years because we needed electricity - I didn’t get it back. My point is, a lot of what people think “white privilege” entails doesn’t actually apply to all white people anymore, and a lot of people of the younger generation are nearly if not entirely disconnected from the flow of wealth that was produced as a result of slavery and it’s enduring economic depression of minorities.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5k for a community college is the lowest average, out of state is 8k, and private is 15k, that is absurdly high.

and yes, universities are almost always in the US, but overall level of education is lower on stuff like basic education, and the funding for schools is horrid.

fine, 40% of 19k gun deaths is still 7600 deaths by guns alone, which is approx 900 more than europe over the entire year (suicides included)

If you do have a gun, there's a significantly &gt;0% chance of you injuring or killing someone with a gun, or someone using your gun against you.

The probability is significant, because while banning guns doesn't eliminate gun ownership, it results in a massively reduced incidence of shootings between people resulting in death or injury.

How would that work. We have gun control, yet millions aren't being killed or imprisoned. The most people dying from violence are from firearms not held by law enforcement. It's like a 1000:1 ratio.

419,"&gt;Are guns essential for revolutionaries?

Yes. As a preventative measure against state violence. However, take your health into account before acquiring a gun.

&gt;Are their more effective ways of self defense?

That largely depends on the person. If they don't ever want to be in the mental turmoil over killing someone who was trying to kill them, it's probably best to learn a good martial art or carry bear mace. 

&gt;Should America have more gun restrictions? 

Hard to say. My understanding is most studies are inconclusive on whether more guns = more crime or whatever. There might be a correlation between gun availability and things like school shootings, but mass murder is so statistically rare it's hard to draw any hard and fast conclusions on how to stop them.

&gt;Are gun laws racist?

They definitely have racist origins. Though it doesn't follow that there shouldn't be restrictions on guns based on that. (Not that I'm advocating for gun restrictions.)

From the article. You literally have the conclusion flipped.

What I'm saying you likely know gun owners without realizing it because they're normal everyday people. Not everyone talks about or admits to ownership. Likely because some people freak out about it.

There are more orgs than the NRA and a lot of gun rights supporters don't like the NRA either. Probably different reasons but other orgs are still growing.

Trump and his allies really, really, really want to blame Black Americans and Democrats for vaccine hesitancy

By Philip Bump
National correspondent
Today at 12:19 p.m. EDT


A good sign that the political right recognizes that the shaky state of the coronavirus pandemic is a function of the unvaccinated is that it is energetically trying to cast that group as largely composed of members of the political left.
Support our journalism. Subscribe today.
Former president Donald Trump, for example, told Fox News Digital on Monday that it was President Biden and Democrats who were the problem.
“If you remember, when I was president, there were literally lines of people wanting to take it,” he said. “Now, you have a different situation, and it’s very bad.”
For a guy who prides himself on his business acumen, this shows a remarkable lack of familiarity with supply and demand. When Trump was president, the pandemic was killing thousands of people every day and those most at risk were clamoring for shots. Over the past seven months, nearly three-quarters of American adults have gotten a vaccine dose and the challenge is specifically that some Americans still refuse to get one. This Trump blamed on Democrats having allegedly claimed that they opposed a vaccine that “Trump came up with” — an effort to both misrepresent the objections made by some Democrats last year (yet again) and to try to suggest that he was central to the vaccine’s development (yet again). Fox News Digital declined to challenge Trump on these assertions.
Story continues below advertisement

Over on the network’s morning show “Fox &amp; Friends,” host Brian Kilmeade regurgitated another common effort to shift the blame off Trump’s political base.
“Why doesn’t the president call out African Americans who put him in office and yell at them to get the shot?” Kilmeade asked Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.) in an interview. After all, he said, only 4 in 10 Black Americans had received a vaccine dose.
This is accurate, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). (The actual figure is 43 percent.) But Kilmeade here is deploying a familiar tactic, using the White-vs.-Black comparison to mask the less favorable but more apropos Democrat-vs.-Republican one. As the KFF found in July, it is the case that Whites are more likely to express willingness to be vaccinated than Black Americans — but only because White Democrats are very likely to be vaccinated. Black Americans are much less hesitant than White Republicans.

New polling from CNN and its partners at SRSS reinforces that point. They found that about 27 percent of Americans hadn’t yet received a dose of a vaccine, including 26 percent of Whites and 32 percent of Blacks. But among White Republicans the figure was 39 percent, compared to 6 percent of White Democrats. It’s also important to contrast lack of vaccination with opposition to vaccination. Only 22 percent of Black respondents told CNN that they wouldn’t get vaccinated, the same as the overall national figure. Among Republicans, more than a third expressed outright opposition.
This comparison is misleading in another way: There are more White Republicans in the United States than Black adults. Twelve percent of the U.S. population is made up of adult Blacks. Adult Whites make up 64 percent of the population, and 28 percent of them are Republican. (An additional 15 percent are Republican-leaning independents.) In other words, there are about twice as many Republican or Republican-leaning White adults as there are Black adults. This is a large part of why the KFF found in July that a majority of those who weren’t vaccinated were Republicans and, again, that the density of those who adamantly oppose vaccination skews more heavily to the right.

Why might Black Americans have lower vaccination rates even while they’re less likely to express vaccine hesitancy? There have been some infrastructural issues at play over the course of the year, and those who have less income — a group that often overlaps with non-White Americans — have been less likely to get a vaccine dose.
There’s another interesting indicator to consider. We pointed out in July that America’s rate of new vaccinations had tapered so dramatically that we were being passed in vaccination rates by other high-income nations including France and Canada. Recent figures from Our World in Data show that the United States is now near the middle of the pack compared to our economic peers — and are about to be passed by some nations that are currently trailing. It’s useful to overlap those numbers with Pew Research Center polling from late July, finding far more hesitancy to coronavirus restrictions among members of the political right in the United States than in other countries. Vaccination rates in the United States are relatively low and not growing quickly even as the politics of the virus in our country is much more polarized.

Then there’s the other rebuttal to the Trump/Kilmeade claims: Biden and Democrats have tried to push hesitant Democrats and Black Americans to get vaccinated. The White House announced a “Shots at the Shop” initiative aimed at involving Black-owned barbershops and salons to support vaccination efforts, for example. In March, it announced a $10 billion effort to target lower-vaccinated areas around the country and it has engaged community organizations in efforts to directly contact people to encourage vaccinations. The White House certainly would agree that indifference to vaccinations is too high in the Black community.

We should be very direct in pointing out that this line of argument, redirecting from one problematic group to another, is well-worn. Why are we accepting Afghan refugees when people in America are starving? Why aren’t Democrats worried about gun violence in Chicago? It’s generally little more than an attempt to rationalize inaction by suggesting that the left is being insincere in its complaints, an attempt that often relies on ignoring the actual efforts of opponents to focus on the very things that are purportedly being ignored.
It also helps divert from their own inaction. Trump has done little to encourage his supporters to get vaccinated after spending a year undercutting government expertise in the hopes of bolstering his reelection chances. Kilmeade has shrugged at the necessity of vaccination, in concert with his network more broadly for much of the year. It’s not just that they’re accusing Biden and the left of failing, it’s that they’re making that accusation while doing little to nothing themselves to encourage success.
Which is why they’re doing it. Lack of vaccinations is a serious problem for national health and the economy. Trump and his allies have promoted skepticism of the vaccines by elevating claims that encouragement to get a shot conflicts with individual freedoms. Now that the damage of that skepticism is readily apparent, they want to push the blame elsewhere.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
442,"Yeah I think, without sounding like a cunt when I say this, that the American gun culture should change. I know you have the constitutional right to bear arms but so does the Swiss and they have some of the lowest gun violence / crimes in the world. And that’s crimes not just fatal shooting which in America would making the numbers sky rocket. Yes I believe that the public and law enforcement should have the right to bear arms but should both be highly trained. Maybe this goes against everything libertarian ?? but I believe that to have the right to bear an arm you should have to have Done time in the military.

445,"Sowell’s edition of the Untied States pre-Roosevelt is certainly fictitious. 

Are you arguing cronyism didn’t exist prior to the New Deal?

I seem to recall another Roosevelt running as a “Trust Buster”, a private security force that was heavily utilized by the “robber barons” of American industry to break unions, run settlers off of the land they’d colonized and assassinate political opponents, and of course a bloody and enduring war against the various indigenous peoples of the Americas and against other Colonists in the name of a manifest destiny that resulted in the theft of territory and the corresponding resources.

And of course, reconstruction and Jim Crow, which is explained by Sowell as a product of a British Red Neck culture, inherited by former slaves, rather than the Antebellum Aristocracy, Northern Industrialists and a dispossessed White underclass that was weaponized against the former property of said aristocrats.

Sowell, of course, blames the culture of the people who were murdered, raped, evicted, robbed and starved and placed into concentration camps at gun point.

Pre-Hoover America was not a capitalist utopia. It was a terrifying world of the “Urban Jungle”, the “Trail of Tears” and the ascent of the 1% in persons like John D. Rockefeller, Thomas Edison and Henry Ford, three  notorious “Crony” capitalists.

You’d do better pointing at Adam Smith’s Scotland, though it was a product of the theft of Asia, Africa and the Americas, which a little Marx  can educate you on.

Capitalism works for those who are the recipients of the spoils of violence and the exploitation of labour.

446,"Why don't you admit that you're a democratic campaign operative?

H.R. 1 was written by and for Democrats to solidify their power.  If it was, as you falsely claim, then there would be at least some GOP support for it.  Yet it has ZERO GOP cosponsors and received ZERO GOP votes.

The bill is entirely too long to go into all the problems with it, but it's intents are clear and well known.

&gt; Democrats would pack SCOTUS like how republicans packed SCOTUS and the federal bench after not processing federal judge nominations and not appointing a judge in 2016 and then going back on that decision in 2020?

Clearly you're uneducated about that which you post.

The GOP did NOT pack SCOTUS.  PACKING the courts is explicilty adding new seats and then filling them with those that would vote to support the party agenda.  The GOP added NO seats to SCOTUS and didn't even float the idea.  They fulfilled their duty to advise and CONSENT.  And before you figure out that what you're trying to refer to, let me help you - it's the non-vote on Garland.  If you were educated you'd find that for over 150 years when the White House and Senate were in different party control no nominee for SCOTUS has been confirmed in an election year.  Exactly what happened with Garland.  And, when the WH and Senate are controlled by the same party, the nominee is confirmed, exactly what happened with Barrett.

On a state level the Dems did indeed pack the court.  The Dems just added seats to the VA Supreme Court and then, in closed session with no GOP members permitted to participate, appointed their people to the slots.  The VA Supreme Court no longer has legitimacy.

&gt; I have no idea how you could consider gun owners (which Terry is one as well) to be fucked. Fucked how?

Assuming Terry is actually a gun owner, he's probably one of those that bought a gun simply so he could say he's a gun owner.  But he is campaigning on the issue of banning assault weapons.  It's on his website.  He also wants to ban standard capacity magazines.  And he's jumped on the bandwagon of declaring ""gun violence"" a ""public health crisis"" when it is nothing of the sort.  Suicide is a mental health issue and guns aren't the only tool.   Other ""gun violence"" is a criminal problem, not a health problem.   Even Chicago has admitted that with their new focus on suing gang members for gun violence.

&gt; And what 'Gun Control' laws are you referencing? Certainly not these?

Absolutely those.

Not one of those bills/laws will do anything to address ""gun violence.""  Some of them duplicate existing law.  One violates federal law and the explicit ""compromise"" made with gun owners decades ago.

&gt; Because half of those I am surprised weren't already laws or covered by other existing laws lol.

I hope you're LOL'ing at yourself.  You've just admitted how uneducated you are on the topic.

&gt; I fail to see how any of these provisions are bad or cause undue hardship?

You'd need a lot of education on that area.  But let's just take the ban on guns on Capitol Square and Gov't buildings.  It will prevent law abiding citizens, with permits to carry, from carrying guns in those areas.  It will NOT actually prevent criminals from carrying guns and other weapons in those areas to commit crimes.  It will just allow an ""also charged with"" indictment if they're prosecuted in the first place.  And we know that over 90% of mass shootings occur in Gun Free Zones and they've just created another.

&gt; So constitutional carry sounds like a bad idea but I think you could pass that in VA with a lot of work.

It won't pass in VA unless there is full GOP control of the state legislature and Governor's office.

&gt; (Looks up definition for preemption) allows you to suddenly say, ""I was in fear for my life!"" And then kill someone.

Wow. The failures here are amazing.  You even said you looked up preemption.  But you clearly didn't.

Preemption is the state preempting any local laws.  It has nothing to do with Stand your Ground or Castle Doctrine (neither of which you likely understand) which already exist in VA via case law.

&gt; where firearms are regularly possessed and then to allow folks to carry 24/7 without any training requirement because its my god given right to do so! Just compounds how horrible of an idea that is lmao.

Just because they don't have a permit doesn't mean they don't have training. And the fact is that over 20 states currently have Constitutional Carry.  And no, they don't have rampant gun violence.  Where is gun violence the worst?  NY, Chicago, and other restrictive carry states.

&gt; removing the in-person requirement also seems like an insanely poorly thought out idea lmao.

There you go again, demonstrating your lack of understanding and then laughing at yourself.

The fact is that we removed the in-person requirement 10 years ago.  And over the 10 year period where it was not in effect we saw no increase in gun deaths in VA.  

Putting the requirement back in was what was poorly thought out and contrary to the data.

&gt; So far the democrats have control of the house, senate, and executive branches and haven't banned guns like everyone has always said,

Only because two Dem Senators voted against the bill.  And the Dems promptly threatened to primary them in the next cycle.  And it may have been influenced by over 22k people showing up armed in Richmond to say ""no.""  And not one person committed any crime and the group left Richmond cleaner than they found it by doing a litter clean up program.

And Terry is campaigning on banning guns.

And Dems have banned guns in other states.  Including confiscation.  NY, CA and others have done exactly this with Dem control.  The Dems of VA want to do the same thing and will if they can.

&gt; If you really think Democrats would 'Solve' any gun issue with legislation you are sadly mistaken.

Well they won't ""solve"" any issues as the legislation only impacts law abiding gun owners - not criminals.  The issues are with the criminals.  Want to solve gun crime issues - bring back Project Exile.

&gt; we transferred $2 trillion to defense contractors over 20 years instead of improving the lives of everyday Americans, etc. etc. ad nauseam...

OK.  Over that time period how much money was spent on homeless programs, SNAP, WIC, Section 8 housing, and other wealth transfer programs?  Do you have any idea?  I doubt it.

&gt;  But supporting H.R. 1 is one of the easiest ways to improve politics in America for anyone of any party.

No it really isn't.

&gt; You may think its some sleeze bill to bring democrats to power and finally enact communism and give our whole country to China.

Yes that's exactly what it is.  And we have AOC and the Squad along with many others that do want to enact communism/socialism.  And we have the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs reportedly colluding with China.

448,"&gt; Kinda like how dangerous it is to have more guns than people in this country, while also being a phenom that creates one helluva systemic barrier to outside aggression, invasion, submission.

Sure, but what's more likely to me than outside aggression, invasion and submission is that the powers-that-be will convince a significant chunk of the population that oppressed people are the real invaders. You load up people with shame to the point that they'll gladly forfeit and all responsibility the moment someone comes along with a scapegoat. You're not going to ask yourself whether the person telling you where to point your musket is the same person who put you under all the shame, fear and anger in the first place.

And in the meantime? Two thirds of all gun deaths in America are suicide. There's an extremely strong narrative in the U.S. that emphasizes shame, deemphasizes responsibility, and tells people their shame can be noble if they express it as self-harm or violence against the most vulnerable in our society.

More explicit versions of these ideas, like the white supremacist ""great replacement theory,"" give people a narrative where *we haven't already been conquered.* Where firearms are protecting us, when in practice we're using them to kill ourselves and defend the people already in power.

Rugged individualism is not protecting people from exploitation in this pandemic. It's telling people that it's OK to hurt themselves and their neighbors, especially the elderly, now children, the poor and the disabled. They're bearing the brunt. And to understand why, you just have to ask yourselves who benefits. Is it doctors, nurses and public health experts who are getting attacked at work and angry mobs at their houses? Or is it the billionaire class, who despite all the economic hardship of the pandemic is somehow amassing *more* wealth?",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

453,"
There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:

• 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)

• 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 489 (2%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location:

298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)

327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)

328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)

764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)

That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.

This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute.

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)

Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well:

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14

Page 15:

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.

Older study, 1995:

https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;context=jclc

Page 164

The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.

r/dgu is a great sub to pay attention to, when you want to know whether or not someone is defensively using a gun

I’ve had a lot of conversations with a lot of American police officers, none of them want gun control. They know the criminals just steal their guns or buy it from the black market. 

Yes, there’s a violence issue. There’s also a disturbing amount of politicians who advocate gun control who end up getting charged for weapons trafficking. They illegalize the guns then sell illegal weapons through gang connections. 

I’d rather that money went to taxes rather than fund a violent gang directly involved with corruption. More gun control just means more corruption and the establishment of a very lucrative black market. 

I don’t know where you’re from, and that’s awesome if gun control works for you guys. Firearms and distrusting the government are heavily ingrained in US culture. America was literally birthed out of distrust for the government and armed citizens. 

In summary, no one values opinions when you 1.don’t understand the situation well enough to appreciate the nuances

459,"My point about the Vietcong is that finding yourself in a sustained firefight is what should be avoided in the first place. And if the situation calls for it, live in squalor and remain hidden to escape and ensure your survival; this is why bushcraft and primative skills training should be sought out. Take passive defensive measures, but direct contact with enemies isn't at the forefront of my mind at all, unlike the nationalist military cult of the Vietcong. LoL I definitely don't have it in me to go full on commie fanatic when danger approaches, it's better to just get away from or avoid it in the first place. Of course being armed will be beneficial in such a dystopia, but run and gun tactics may be better, and only as a last resort, than digging in for sustained conflict. Plus you won't want to give your position away. And why the hell wouldn't you set up a perimeter of booby traps if you're being pursued or threatened by an armed force? I think it's best to avoid getting shot at as much as possible.

Your statement about people in south Africa ignores the years horrible ethnic strife of apartheid. Much of what drive that violence has deep roots in a very, very fucked up history of colonial oppression. Those people are pissed as fuck, their destruction is driven by their feelings injustice, severe poverty, and horrible generational abuse. Will something like that go down in America? I'm not sure of that. If a dozen armed people come into your neighborhood, it would be best to immediately execute your evacuation plan to another cache, and be prepared to cut your losses if they raid the house because you guys didn't put all your eggs (and rice and beans, etc.) In one basket. The lesson from the Vietcong is their logistical capabilities!

Given the high value of our currency, the only reason that people arent banding together to solve these social issues in effective ways has to do with a lack of imagination.

460,"&gt;No conservative I know has any issue with the concept of Free Healthcare

As you go on to name three clear reasons the majority of conservatives do not agree with or want free Healthcare. 

I actually completely agree with you on American liberties and the need to protect them, and I'm pretty generally pro second amendment. Which also means I completely agree with you on the real root causes of gun violence in America, it's not the guns themselves it's the world we've built around them. However, just like the person you're replying to said and you inadvertently validated above, conservative policies don't act to fix the greater issues that plague our nation and cause such a high level of violence in general. If the stance of the average conservative really was ""guns aren't the problem, America at its core is flawed and needs to be fixed"" like you're implying, you would think conservatives would be pushing for local social change at the very least. It's all well and good to say you don't trust the federal governments ability to spend and so social safety net type policy shouldn't be happening on a federal level, but why is it not then happening on a local level in conservative run places? You don't see massive socialistic protections or policies in Kentucky or Missouri, some of the most hardline conservative states in the nation. If no conservative takes issue with these wildly popular concepts directly, just the federal governments ability to implement them, why have they not taken local affect in primarily conservative places? On the inverse, if Liberals are more concerned with blaming gun violence on the existence of guns and not America's greater issues, why are left leaning politicians the ones more often implementing or introducing policies specifically meant to tackle those greater issues?",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;I’m not some sort of gun toting “rise up against the power” imbecile. I’m saying given the option of bending over and spreading my ass cheeks or fighting I would rather fight. Not having guns removes that option. No matter what situation happens in Australia, the citizens won’t be able to defend themselves.

464,"Mao said, ""Power grows out of the end of a gun."" I think he was right, and that nothing short of widescale political violence will bring about a post-capitalist state here in the United States.

To that effect, some hardline communists say that this or that person will get ""the wall"" when their revolution comes. As a person who would prefer a mixed economy like we see in a number of Scandinavian countries over communism, I'm presuming that I would be on that list. 

I was trying (and I guess failing) to ""yes and..."" your assertion that I'm a right-winter, which apparently I am by the standards of the modern Left. Given what I've seen of revolutions and civil war, I'd really rather die than live through the years of terror and privation that are nearly inevitable. 

As of ""Glorious People's Revolution,"" it was a bit of silliness on my part--kind of a half-assed reference to the sanitary hyperbole that obscures the violent actions of communist regimes. ""Great Leap Forward,"" for example. For sure, capitalist leaders are guilty of often doing the same thing. ""Make America Great Again"" seems to be more about exclusion and cruelty than improving our lives, but that's just my take. 

You know how I said I don't give a shit? Really, it's deeper than that. I'm tired of all of this stuff. I don't think human civilization in its current form is tenable, and that we're in the final, sweltering hours of what you and I might recognize as modernity. We're actually past the tipping point for climate change now, and according to guys like Roy Scranton (""Learning to Die in the Anthropocene"" is badass), it's too damned late for things like wind and solar energy, nuclear energy, carbon sinks, or cap and trade economic policies to make a difference. 

I think the next century is going to be an incredibly bloody one. People don't seem to know that climate change is already playing a big part in why we have so many stupid wars. For example, extreme drought exacerbated current political tensions in and around Syria, leading to the civil war that everyone now seems to have a finger in. Hell, crop failure helped to spark all of the trouble in Somalia back in the nineties. Now imagine all of this stuff amped up to a hundred, with people fighting over dwindling supplies of arable land, water, and (naturally) all of those conflict minerals. Toss in starving and jobless refugees, terrorists, emerging novel viruses, and what appears to me to be an all-out war on knowledge itself and you've got a fucking recipe for a future I'm glad I won't be alive for and feel powerless to prevent. (Gotta make a book recommendation here: ""Tropic of Chaos: Climate Change and the New Geography of Violence"" by Christian Parenti.)

The thing is that a lot of this is going to happen here in the First World, too. Europe isn't immune (Holy shit, the Mediterranean is actually seeing the arrival of what used to be ""Third World"" diseases, plus coastlines are rising, etc.), and North America isn't either. We've already got people traveling from hurricane areas, and where I live in the Southwest is probably not going to sustain life at all in a hundred years or more thanks to water shortages. We're already having droughts. Look at what the oil industry already does wherever it is discovered and you'll see a preview of what's coming for everyone else. If you haven't read it yet, Peter Maas's ""The Crude World: The Violent Twilight of Oil"" is eye-opening. 

I think our oligarchs--the guys who really run things around here--know exactly what's going on, and they're making plans for a future where practically everyone else but them is sick, starving, poor, and very angry. Look at guys like Peter Thiel: He's playing a longterm game of destabilizing democracy and deregulating business, all the while building his own personal redoubt in New Zealand. 

Like I said, I'd prefer a mixed economic system for a number of reasons, among them universal healthcare and education for all, but I don't think that my wishes (or yours for that matter unless you're a stratospherically wealthy Robber Baron) are going to make much of a difference. What I absolutely DO know is that I'm going to have to earn a living in order to keep the lights on while all of this shit inevitably crumbles. 

It occurred to me while I was writing this response that you might possibly enjoy ""The Collapse of Western Civilization: A View from the Future"" by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway. It is written as a report by a 24th century anonymous Chinese scholar on the death of the west and why China managed to endure. Some of it is actually inaccurate now (China produces more Greenhouse Gases that America and Russia, for example.) but one of the arguments the character puts forth is that it was easier for China's authoritarian government to make the changes necessary to prepare for the coming global economic instability, whereas democracies were unable to come together in time. It's science-fiction, but if you love speculative fiction that hews close to reality then you'll probably dig it. They're friends of Kim Stanley Robinson, who wrote the ""Science in the Capital,"" series. It's considered a canonical work of what people call cli-fi now, so the influence is definitely there.

Two decades after the attack on New York City, the Police Department is using counterterrorism tools and tactics to combat routine street crime.

It was an unusual forearm tattoo that the police said led them to Luis Reyes, a 35-year-old man who was accused of stealing packages from a Manhattan building’s mailroom in 2019.

But the truth was more complicated: Mr. Reyes had first been identified by the New York Police Department’s powerful facial recognition software as it analyzed surveillance video of the crime.

His guilty plea earlier this year was not solely the result of keen-eyed detectives practicing old school police work. Instead, it was part of the sprawling legacy of one of the city’s darkest days.

Since the fall of the World Trade Center, the security apparatus borne from the Sept. 11 attack on the city has fundamentally changed the way the country’s largest police department operates, altering its approach to finding and foiling terror threats, but also to cracking minor cases like Mr. Reyes’s.

New Yorkers simply going about their daily lives routinely encounter post-9/11 digital surveillance tools like facial recognition software, license plate readers or mobile X-ray vans that can see through car doors. Surveillance drones hover above mass demonstrations and protesters say they have been questioned by antiterrorism officers after marches. The department’s Intelligence Division, redesigned in 2002 to confront Al Qaeda operatives, now uses antiterror tactics to fight gang violence and street crime.

Policing technology has always advanced along with the world at large. And the police have long used surveillance cameras to find suspects caught on video, publicizing images of people and asking the public for help identifying them. But both supporters and critics of the shift say it is almost impossible to overstate how profoundly the attacks changed American policing — perhaps most acutely in New York, which lost 23 of its own officers that day, and hundreds more from 9/11-related illnesses in the years since.

The Police Department has poured resources into expanding its surveillance capabilities. The department’s budget for intelligence and counterterrorism has more than quadrupled, spending more than $3 billion since 2006, and more through funding streams that are difficult to quantify, including federal grants and the secretive Police Foundation, a nonprofit that funnels money and equipment to the department from benefactors and donors.

Current and former police officials say the tools have been effective in thwarting dozens of would-be attacks. And the department has an obligation, they say, to repurpose its counterterrorism tools for everyday crime fighting.

“It’s what everybody would want us to be doing,” said John Miller, the deputy commissioner for the Police Department’s Intelligence and Counterterrorism Bureaus, “instead of just saying, ‘Well, these were just for counterterrorism. So if it’s not a bombing we’re not going to use them. I’m sorry you got mugged.’”

But others say the prevalence of the department’s technological arsenal subjects ordinary New Yorkers to near-constant surveillance — a burden that falls more heavily on people of color. According to one estimate from a recent analysis by Amnesty International that was shared with The New York Times, a person attending a protest between Washington Square Park and Sixth Avenue — a common route through the park and into the city for protests after the death of George Floyd last summer — would be captured on the police department’s array of Argus video cameras for about 80 percent of their march.

Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president and the heavy favorite to become the city’s next mayor, said in an interview that he intends to audit and re-evaluate how counterterrorism and surveillance resources are deployed and used in the city.

“I’m a believer in using technology to keep us safe,” said Mr. Adams, a former New York City police captain. “I don’t believe in using technology to dismantle our rights that exist in our country.”

Derrick Ingram was accused of speaking into a bullhorn near an officer at a protest. The police descended on his home with a response he said would have been appropriate for a terror attack. 

Derrick Ingram remembers the laser — that red dot, hovering in his bedroom, trained there by an armed police officer posted across the courtyard from his apartment last summer.

“It was one of the most intense experiences,” he said.

The police had identified Mr. Ingram using facial recognition tools they applied to his Instagram profile, intercepted his phone calls and used drones to peer inside his apartment. Dozens of officers descended. The response seemed suited to a terror threat, Mr. Ingram said.

“It kind of felt stupid. I felt like it was a waste of taxpayer money and funds,” Mr. Ingram said. “We’ve created a monster that’s kind of always existed within America, but we’ve given that monster — because of 9/11, because of other terrorist attacks and things that have happened — unquestionable, unchecked power.”

Safeguards meant to limit the police’s ability to monitor political activity were suspended. Thousands of additional cameras and license plate readers were installed around Manhattan, part of the Lower and Midtown Manhattan Security Initiatives.

Only recently — because of a law passed by the City Council last summer, to police officials’ dismay — did the breadth of the Police Department’s surveillance dragnet begin to become clear. The law, known as the POST Act, requires the department to provide a public accounting of its post-9/11 technological arsenal.

Police officials have proven reluctant to fully comply with the transparency requirements, and have historically kept such expenditures secret even from the city’s own comptroller. But according to figures maintained by the city’s Independent Budget Office, the Police Department’s spending on intelligence and counterterrorism nearly quadrupled between 2006 and 2021, up to $349 million from $83 million in 2006, the earliest year for which the office keeps data.

He challenged the notion that the surveillance apparatus in New York troubled many residents; most Americans are used to having their pictures taken even while shopping in a department store, he said.

“Your picture was probably taken 30 times while you were in that store,” said Mr. Kelly. “I don’t think the average person has the concern about privacy that many of these activist groups have.”

In documents released earlier this year, the police acknowledged their use of a vast network of license plate readers, thousands of surveillance cameras, mobile X-ray vans and digital tools that are used to scrub social media profiles and retain deleted information. Much of the resulting data can be collected and stored without a warrant.

The tactics have become ubiquitous in criminal cases, including investigations of low-level crime. Asked to identify recent cases in which the police used such surveillance measures, public defenders from across the city said it was difficult to think of one that had not.

“My office defends tens of thousands of cases each year, and I would be shocked if we have a single case of any level of severity that did not include some form of surveillance technology,” said Elizabeth Vasquez, the director of the science and surveillance project at Brooklyn Defender Services.

Most often used, lawyers say, is the Police Department’s Domain Awareness System, which fuses data from several different surveillance tools — license plate readers, closed-circuit television streams, images that can be analyzed with facial recognition software, or phone call histories — and associates the data with a person or address.

The police say safeguards exist around the information that the department collects — warrants, for example, are sometimes required to query stored data, and facial recognition software cannot be the sole reason for an arrest. But civil liberties advocates say the kaleidoscopic data network collected by the police has effectively turned the city into a surveillance state, even for law-abiding New Yorkers.

The department established a counterterrorism bureau and remade its intelligence division, including the so-called Demographics Unit — a secretive police unit that kept tabs on Muslim New Yorkers, even without evidence of a crime.

“The theory was, in the course of regular policing, police officers around the country would run across little bits of information that, when added to other kinds of information, would potentially reveal terrorist plots in the making,” said Faiza Patel, the director for the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, which researches the intersection of civil liberties and surveillance. “In order to do that, they really lowered the threshold for information collection.”

The department still defends its practices, but later settled a lawsuit alleging it had illegally spied on Muslim New Yorkers, and officials say it no longer employs the kinds of demographic surveillance it used following the Sept. 11 attacks. Today, many of the division’s resources have returned to tracking gang conflicts and gun crime (it also maintains a division to track extremist groups).

Still, the scars from the surveillance of Muslim New Yorkers remain, and the policing methods behind it — data collection and intelligence-gathering — have stuck.

“When the definition of ‘terrorism’ becomes anyone you don’t agree with, that’s utterly terrifying,” said Hannah Shaw, who was arrested during a protest last summer and turned over to federal antiterrorism agents for questioning.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
466,"Except there’s more to crime and a countries crime issues that just looking at homicide rates. American is not Europe. America has God knows how many different cultures and cultural rifts you will have friction on an ideological base which can add to homicide rates.

Second, having lax gun laws does not equal all crime since gun crime statistics include all forms of gun violence, suicide, accidental, criminal, etc. California has some strict gun laws yet ranks second on the highest rate of homicides in the country. Texas is first yet that state has a host of problems including cartel problems, and yes I’ve been down by El Paso for several years and it was not uncommon to hear about some shooting kicking off at a random party or some drug conflict kicking off. Missouri is the capitol of Meth and there is a crime problem within that ring, yet again these rates have another factor involved rather than it being purely based on a gun. A dude on meth will rob you if he needs meth, security measures or not a gun is the only determining factor where I live that I rely on.

467,"But… but we had 3,000 school shootings in 201X… yes I count hunters firing a gun technically on school property and someone shooting a BB gun in that number but still… 

The misinformation about guns/gun violence is insane. Yes we have a gun problem in America and 1 school shooting is too many but to act like we have multiple bonafide school shootings everyday is so dishonest and evil. 

If a rival gang does a drive by and kills 3 opposing gang members is that technically a mass shooting? Yes.
Is it used tp pump up mass shooting numbers when reporting horrific events when a crazed individual goes to shoot up a crowd of strangers with the express purpose of murdering as many as he can? You betcha.

Are those two events worthy of being combined into the same statistics? Not in my opinion.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

469,"“Most don’t own guns” is probably incorrect. Most probably don’t actually talk about it. 

While the estimates are all over the map, (low end 80 million, high end 285 million,) the amount of firearms owners is probably close to 200 million +|-.

The small arms survey estimates that in 2017 130 million people owned firearms in America. 2018 it was estimated to be up to 155-175 million. Between 2019 till 2021 the amount of new owners is estimated to have gone up by 45-65 million firearms owners. The new owners since 2019 have predominately been women, minorities, and surprisingly Democrats. Conservatives still own more but liberals are quickly catching up. 

As for gun control, I agree that most want reasonable gun control that actually has effect on crime and violence. Bans and confiscations won’t work, to many laws and  Scotus rulings. Not to mention firearms, something like 400 million or more at this point.

470,"That doesn't back up what you said?

That says 256k children have been exposed to gun violence in 278 schools since Columbine.

Columbine was in 1999. Feel free to double check my math, but I don't think 278 over 22 years adds up to one a day...

Also the article says

&gt; Still, school shootings remain rare, and only a tiny percentage of the tens of millions of students in America ever experience them

471,"I can't say I fully agree with you but I can definitely see where you're coming from. It's refreshing to have a civil discussion about this, so thanks. 

Concerning the ""tyrannical government"" scenario, I think the problem of that thought experiment is simply the fact that it's a hypothetical scenario, so unrealistic by nature. If the US is suddenly taken over by madmen, but as you say they don't have the army's cooperation, then yes, it won't last long (and no need for civilians to have weapons since the army has it covered). If they don't, how did they take over in the first place, especially a country the size of a continent, like America? They would have had to do things way worse than drop bombs. So either this hypothetical takeover is done without caring about the people (in which case dropping a few bombs will certainly placate them for a while), or at least with near full cooperation of the armed forces, because without it there is no logistical way to operate a takeover of any territory other than the seat of government.

I always kind of saw the attachment to this hypothetical as a heritage of the war of independence, and the fear of being (re)conquered by the British Empire, something long obsolete by now.

For me, the only things truly threatening the American nation are incompetent leadership, anti-democratic populists, and corruption, which are all way too insidious to be fought in the open, with guns and weapons. They're much harder to fight because the enemy keeps coming back. And yes, the two-party system is a blight on this earth and you're pretty unlucky to live with such a restrictive, ""least awful choice"" system.

Honestly, tell me if I'm wrong on any of this, I aim to learn, but try to see things from my perspective: you say history has shown that it doesn't help to disarm people, but from my point of view, my country and those around it never have mass shootings or gun violence while America does, and another difference is civilians don't have guns while in America they do. 

That said, I know correlation doesn't always equate causation, and I'll agree that America is a very special case in its geography, demographic dynamics, and culture, so applying the same conditions won't always end in the same results. Just explaining what lead to the assumption I hold on this particular issue",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
472,"Your first claim is empirically false. Less guns leads to less deadly violence and death overall. Especially with suicide. Not having a gun makes suicide a lot less appealing, considering that other methods are either more painful or take more time to carry out. That alongside the fact that suicide is in most cases a spur of the moment decision, which makes it terrible to have a relatively easy death option sitting in your home with you. As for violence, fewer guns equals less gun homicides and therefore less deaths [link](https://www.nber.org/digest/feb01/fewer-guns-mean-fewer-gun-homicides). I can’t speak on the amount of crime (though I would assume that would also decrease) but violent crimes that do occur would be less deadly.

The situation in Afghanistan and Vietnam is massively different to what would take place here. The result would be more like China’s Tiananmen protests than it would anything else. American troops are fighting on home turf, against a less equipped force, with a lot more moral than they ever could have in Nam/Afghanistan. 

I’m fairly confident that a full on tyrannical America is quite a while away.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
473,"Extremely unpopular opinion butttttt.....as a Black American who lives in the ""hood"" surrounded by mostly good people with an strong element of crime and violence, I am pro-gun *and* pro-gun control. 

Criminals have weapons, mostly purchased illegally on the black market, so restricting my ability to protect my children would put me in harm's way. At the same time, I believe people shouldn't be able to purchase semi-automatic weapons without training and a federal paper trail to follow. I don't think citizens should be restricted in the number of firearms or ammunition purchased legally.

I think the system for purchasing firearms is broken in America but our government is not trustworthy enough for me to give up my pistol. 

I think it's too late for European style gun control but we can make some changes that reduce the number of shootings here.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
474,First off yes criminals owning guns promote those criminals to commit crimes. Granted no us state provides legal sale of firearms to felons. Therefore they’re getting them from other methods than legal purchase. Meaning no ones supplying criminals with guns legally. But I’m guess you’re staying that someone owning a gun makes them more likely to be robbed or burglarized and that’s the largest load of shit I’ve ever heard there’s is no way to provide evidence people are being robbed specifically because they own guns. Also owning guns isn’t violent or a promotion of violence. We see guns as being exclusively violent but that’s not true. Many people irl own weapons of a large variety other than guns and we don’t consider them violent. Why?  because they’re not as easy to use as a gun? My point also is specifically about night city by the way not real life which you and many other consistently want to speak about. But with all honest taking guns away from innocent citizens BEFORE removing them from criminals will only make crime rates rise. If you could remove both at once that’s a perfect solution but you can’t . Could you honestly say you’d feel safe in the us knowing that any violent criminals that exist probably have a gun and that you yourself couldn’t own one? Me personally I live 2 hours away from any police station. And while I don’t own a gun when I do eventually get my own home if it’s somewhere rural like I am at now and police response times are understandably slow I will probably get a gun for home defense until my country proves to me I don’t need one. America is not a country where criminals don’t have guns. They do have them and no mater the laws put into place they’ll still be there. People are safer with the ability to defend themselves on an equal field to the criminals around them. This is not saying though that places like Australia and Europe etc that have never let guns be in the hands of its citizens would be safer with guns. That’s not true because you don’t have a shit load of example of gun wielding violent offenders so those countries citizens don’t need guns.,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
475,"&gt;American gun culture really is something disgusting.

Its not at all. The rate of gun incidents in the US is massively exaggerated.

Especially when it comes to mass shootings.

First of all ""mass shooting"" is not even clearly defined in any way in which everyone agrees.

Secondly using the broadest term, counting all deaths from 1949 to now you come up with 600 deaths. If you do not count the perpetrators, cause fuck them assholes, you get 581.

In a country of 330,000,000 and growing, 581 deaths is 0.0001% of the population.

0.0001% of 330 million is considered a round off error.

It is statistically insignificant.

Now, this is not to say it is not tragic, but at no point does 0.0001% of the country dying to X reason rise to the level needed to remove civil rights from the citizens of the country.

Here are some quick statistics on gun violence in America:

In 2018, there were roughly 40,000 gun related deaths, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the maths: 0.0122% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those roughly 40,000 deaths:

• 24,000 (60%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3). This varies year by year between 60% and 70%.

• 1,000 (2.5%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 500 (1.25%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 40,000 annually, but rather roughly 13,500... 0.004% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location. According to a review of FBI homicide statistics (6), the 10 cities with the highest firearm homicide rates (Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, Louisville, Milwaukee, St.Louis, Baltimore, Birmingham, Memphis, and New Orleans) make up roughly 20% of those deaths.

This leaves 10,800 deaths for everywhere else in America... about 200 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 10,000 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)

You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)

Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 62% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14

Page 15:

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.

Older study, 1995:

https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;context=jclc

Page 164

The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.

r/dgu is a great sub to pay attention to, when you want to know whether or not someone is defensively using a gun

476,"No. This is America, where everyone is *supposed* to be equal. 

I’m not advocating we should fall to fighting each other. I don’t want a civil war anymore than you do. I’d like to see us come together as Americans. 

But, that might not end up being an option. You can’t ignore antifa attacking people because they are wearing MAGA hats or going out of their way to attack people of opposing ideology, when those people went out of their way to avoid confrontation with them. 

You can’t ignore the growing hostility from the left, or their frequent calling  for violence, or government oppression, against conservatives...and libertarians, really. The left is very emotion driven. They truly believe they are the saviors of humanity and socialism is the answer. This gives a moral sense of justification to them for anything they do, now. I just read of a security guard ( who was a felon and had no business owning a gun ) shooting a guy for not wearing a mask. 

I’ve seen them calling for this kind of violence against people not wearing masks, for some time. Now, it’s happened. They have been calling for violence against conservatives and gun owners for some time, too. How long is it going to be before antifa isn’t the only ones on the left willing to commit that violence?

Would I suggest taking the fight to them? Of course not. I’d like to see people come together and realize government is the real enemy. I hope this can happen. Our enemies, and even our allies, will have a field day if we truly become a nation at war with itself. 

But, if I find myself or my family at risk because of violence, from any source, I won’t stand by and do nothing about it. And, I wouldn’t think to tell anyone else they should, either. In the end, you have to take care of your own. 

And, sooner or later, if we can’t secure the liberty the constitution guarantees, and it looks like we are finally left no other options, we will have to do what the founding fathers intended for such a situation: the people will have to defend their liberty from tyrannical government.

Hopefully, we can find a way to communicate with words and come together as The People, so none of that ends up having to happen. That must be our goal. But, we can’t afford to ignore the potential possibilities that could be ahead of us. That would be foolish.

477,"Yes, a few of those are correct, some incorrect, and some completely irrelevant. And as far as guns go, America unsurprisingly has one of the highest rates of gun violence of any modern countries. Who cares about Olympic medals? The Olympics is quite irrelevant in my opinion and having athletes winning medals who represent us really does not progress us as a country. Also, I wouldn't say oil is something to be proud of either. America is responsible for the most oil barrels produced in the world. Because of this and related products and how coupled it is to our economy, we've seen mass politicization against means to transition to more sustainable energy sources and preservation of the environment. Not something to be proud of. And as far as the military goes, China has the strongest military, and regardless, it seems that although we have the strongest military, we seem to have quite a  weakness against poor countries. It honestly seems like the poorer the country the less likely we are to succeed. Take Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, etc. for example. 

To conclude the point I'm trying to make, you are knit picking things to try to prove 'Murica is the best'. In reality, countries like China are catching up in many areas at exponential rates. It's time to face the truth and realize that America has taken a hard turn downhill and so many things need to change. And yes, the US is absolutely vital to global humanitarian efforts, international economies, and much more. This being said, America is quickly being pushed out of the way and is also responsible for so much of the issues which we're trying to solve at the same time. Like war and pollution.

You know how many times guns are used to stop a crime or death without even having to pull the trigger most of the time? 
Ill tell you that number. 3 million plus times.

It makes men and women equal. When otherwise they would just have to submit. 
You know our founding fathers that created this country had to go to war over a 2% tea tax and they beat that country and earned their independence from it with just a bunch of civilians and muskets. 
No well armed army with tanks and fighter jets. 
Just cannons,  muskets and war ships. 
They made sure that the people would have the right to legally do that again when needed.

Do you think, after this nonsense pandemic and government mandated house arrest on healthy people, forced closing of peoples buisnesses for ever, mass suicides because of it. 
That worse wont happen again? Or that the future looks up to you? 
Like nothing can go wrong. No collapse of everything.
 You trust that if someone breaks into your home the cops will make it there in time to save your life? 
How about this. Say youre in a mall and some psycho comes in with a gun and starts unloading on people. You hide in a Quiznos but he is walking through executing people. 
Youre telling me youd be someone that just begged for your life while he shot people around you one by one till he got to you? 
( dont think that guns being banned will make criminals who have never followed the law will nit be armed. It will be the law abiding that give up their guns)

While he was importing RPG's and belt fed 50bmg hummer mounted heavy machine guns into china town for years selling them to the chinese mafia? 

You know why he made it illegal for citizens to defend themselves? To drive the price up of those RPG's and to appeal to the low IQ voter that just liked the thought of being safer.

Don’t get me wrong, I think cops have plenty of problems, but the idea that they just gun down innocents is wrong.

481,"Seriously right? You're welcome to hate them, I get it, this country definitely has a gun culture issue that needs some addressing. But to say that we should just disarm after an attempt at a literal fascist takeover is like, kind of proving the founding fathers were right about wanting the populace as a whole to be armed. We've already proved time and time again, especially in Vietnam and Afghanistan, that a well armed insurgency can go toe to toe with the US military any day. I sincerely hope it never happens, but that's how America was founded, and I can see the logic in it as such. People love to go on like it'll ""never happen today"", while coups against democracy happen around the world, most recently in myanmar just this year. You simply cannot argue that with right wing extremism surging in the united states, and an unarmed mob almost succeeding, that there's zero chance they won't try again and be armed. There's still several steps they'd have to get past first, like the fact that the top military brass was behind democracy and probably would not have gone along with them, and the national guard would have also stepped in sooner, were it not for it basically seeming like the lack of capital security was intentional on that day. But yea, maybe if we actually properly funded social programs in this country, we wouldn't have so many people willing to choose violence? Or people wanting to commit suicide, of which a great many use guns only due to ease of access, with pills being similarly as common. Especially looking at actual mass shootings (any shooting in which 4 people are shot is classified as a ""mass shooting"", which dramatically boosts statistics, when most are gang related or interpersonal issues between people who know each other), which would probably see the biggest drop off of any if we properly took care of the people. In short, we created the problems we see today with guns for ourselves, but I don't believe guns are the primary issue, merely a symptom of it as a byproduct of their ready availability, rather than the availability being the root issue like so many on the left believe.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

486,"Found this comment on another post:

Seems everyone needs some perspective on gun violence in America.

There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:

• 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)

• 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 489 (2%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location:

298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)

327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)

328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)

764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)

That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.

This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)

You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)

Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14

Page 15:

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.

Older study, 1995:

https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;context=jclc

Page 164

The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.

r/dgu is a great sub to pay attention to, when you want to know whether or not someone is defensively using a gun

495,"&gt; MEXICO CITY — The Mexican government sued several major U.S.-based gun manufacturers Wednesday, alleging that lax controls contribute to the illegal flow of weapons over the border.

&gt; The unusual suit — filed in U.S. federal court in Boston — seeks unspecified financial compensation from the companies but does not target the U.S. government.

&gt;Mexican authorities argue that American-made weapons have fueled an explosion in homicides in this nation over the past decade. Around 2.5 million illicit American guns have poured across the border during that period, according to a Mexican government study released last year. Legal gun sales in Mexico are tightly restricted.

&gt;“If we don’t file a suit like this and win it, they’re never going to understand, they’re going to continue doing the same thing and we will continue having deaths every day in our country,” Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said at a news conference.

&gt;Security experts in Mexico saw the lawsuit as an attempt to raise the profile of gun-trafficking issues but one unlikely to lead to a legal victory. A U.S. law that took effect in 2005 shields gun manufacturers from most civil liability claims.

&gt;The legal action “sends a statement and creates a pressure point with the Biden administration,” said Alejandro Hope, a Mexico City-based security consultant. “But I don’t think the Mexican government is expecting to win.”

&gt;The suit names companies including Smith &amp; Wesson Brands, Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Beretta USA, Glock and Colt’s Manufacturing Co.

&gt;In addition to financial damages — which Mexican officials estimated could run to $10 billion if the legal action is successful — the suit also seeks tighter controls on sales and better security features on weapons.

&gt;The companies did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association for the American firearms industry, rejected the claims that U.S. gun manufacturers were negligent.

&gt;“These allegations are baseless,” said Lawrence G. Keane, the group’s senior vice president and general counsel. “The Mexican government is responsible for the rampant crime and corruption within their own borders.”

&gt;Cross-border trafficking has created a growing pool of weapons that circulate among armed groups in Mexico. The most powerful guns go to large drug cartels, and older, smaller weapons find their way into the hands of lower-level criminals.

&gt;“Because of the abundance of firearms, now every little gangster has AK-47s or Barrett .50s,” said Ioan Grillo, author of the book “Blood Gun Money: How America Arms Gangs and Cartels.” “Then there’s the spillover effect, when cartels send ‘burned weapons’ to streets and you have schoolkids buying them.”

&gt;The ease with which Mexican cartels can access military-grade weapons has fundamentally altered the challenge faced by the country’s security forces.

&gt;“State police and municipal police have kind of melted away,” Grillo said. “They’re not going to fight against guys with .50-calibers,” Grillo said.

&gt;If local police are not intimidated, they are often bought off by crime groups, security analysts say.

&gt;The lawsuit maintains that the U.S. arms manufacturers “are conscious of the fact that their products are trafficked and used in illicit activities” in Mexico, according to a document from the Foreign Ministry.

&gt;“Nonetheless, they continue to prioritize their economic benefit, and use marketing strategies to promote weapons that are ever more lethal, without mechanisms of security or traceability,” it continued.

&gt;The government alleges that U.S. gunmakers design weapons that will appeal to Mexican crime groups — citing, for example, a Colt .38 Super pistol engraved with an image of revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata. That model of handgun was used in the assassination of an investigative journalist, Miroslava Breach, in 2017.

&gt;“It is difficult to read this complaint without coming to the conclusion that, as a matter of ethical business practices, there is no defense to what these companies have done,” said Adam Skaggs, policy director with the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

&gt;Still, he said, the case will be tough to win, because of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which bars most civil lawsuits against arms companies after their guns are misused. The Mexican government’s case argues that the 2005 measure immunizes the gun industry only from lawsuits involving violence in the United States.

&gt;Arms trafficking is hardly the only thing fanning violence in Mexico. The nature of the drug trade has changed in recent years, with cartels splintering into smaller, feuding groups that have diversified into extortion, kidnapping and other criminal activities.

&gt;Successive Mexican presidents have tried to stanch the violence by overhauling the justice system, arresting drug kingpins and providing job programs to lure young people away from crime. But they have achieved few results. Security analysts say the government has not had the political will to carry out a more profound transformation of the courts and police.

&gt;Mexican authorities said several recent U.S. cases had given them hope their lawsuit could succeed. Among them was a judge’s decision that survivors and relatives of a 2019 shooting at a California synagogue could move ahead with a lawsuit against the manufacturer of the weapon used in the attack.

&gt;U.S. analysts say policy changes such as an assault-weapons ban and universal background checks for gun buyers would reduce trafficking. But the Mexican government, they say, has come to doubt that those changes will happen.

&gt;“It’s not surprising that they’re looking for other ways to either bring awareness to the issue or correct it,” said Eugenio Weigend, the director for gun-violence prevention at the Center for American Progress.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
496,"Gun violence in America has mostly cultural reasons and if they didn't have guns, they'd just stab each other instead. Every household in Switzerland has an automatic service rifle in the basement and their gun homicide rates are on par with countries that have completely banned guns. A gun is just a tool that isn't any more dangerous than a knife, a chainsaw, or a pickup truck.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
497,"What Americans don't realize is that they're directly responsible for a lot of the 'illegal' immigration into their country. 

- Most Mexican refugees are fleeing drug violence. Mexico has extremely restrictive gun laws with only a single gun store in the entire country. However, the cartels in Mexico smuggle in weaponry from across the US border and pay for the smuggled weaponry with money they gain by selling drugs in USA. If America didn't heavily criminalize drug usage (which makes illegal drugs both valuable and creates a black market) and had stricter gun laws, Mexicans wouldn't have had to face the violence they do today. 

- America has waged various kinds of attacks against Central American governments to ensure that the governments of these countries are in line with American foreign policy. 
     - Funding, training and arming the Contras - a Nicaraguan terrorist group responsible for a host of human rights violations and 
    - Propping up a Guatemalan regime that has committed a genocide. 
    - Panama was first subjected to a brutal US-backed and drug money funded dictatorship under Noriega and then invaded by the US. 
    - Funding and arming Salvadoran death squads to the tune of 1 million dollars a day during the Salvadoran civil war responsible for around 85% of all attacks on civilians. 
  - Orchestrating the 2009 coup in Honduras. 
The development of these countries has been markedly affected by US interference and so the US is morally bound to accept refugees from these countries. 

- As for Arab refugees, well, America's involvement in Middle East historically and presently don't require any explanation. 

So, this Refugee crisis that is often spoken about is not really a crisis. It is just the result of American foreign policy. In other words, America is responsible for almost every refugee at its doorstep and it has no right to say no to anyone at its borders as long as it continues to both interfere in other nations and sustain conditions that are directly responsible for the creation of refugees.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
498,"&gt; Again, GOOGLE IS FREE !! Or if you can't afford a internet connexion, you go to the fucking library!!

In South Korea, people use Naver. [As it says here,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver) three quarters of all web searches go through Naver, which brings up primarily Korean based results, many of which come through Naver's own platform. Therefore, if one is searching for things, you would get very different results depending on what you searched for and in what language. The vast majority of research on cultural appropriation and the media response to it is *in English*. Most idols speak *conversational* English at best. For most idols, the shit that is the bread and butter of the news does not cross their radar on the news or in the media. You're assuming that people will hear something on the news, and take the bus tomorrow morning down to the library to research it. Nobody does this in day to day life. If they're interested in it as a hobby or for work, then maybe, but if it doesn't come up in day to day life, why would you go looking for it, when you're busy with other things. It's not an excuse, it's ignorance, but so is expecting someone who hear a word or a phrase in a different language, look it up, read it, *usually in their second or third language*, and internalize that message and understand what it means in context. We have white people who spend their lives insisting it isn't true, so clearly, it's not a universal thing. 

&gt; We are in the age of technology, you wanna know something, you search it. You are looking for something you search it. It's not difficult. I'm not from neither Korea or America but since I'm interested in both, i learn about their culture, the things we can say, the things we can't. 3 months ago, i didn't know there was a ""R"" slur, because English is not my language. And in my language the word is not a slur, but it is in English. I looked it up, printed it in my brain and then went about my life. It took me less then 30 mins. Why is it so hard for kpop idols ?

Because someone told you that was wrong. Prior to that moment, you could have use the r-word countless times, in front of countless people, and been unaware of how someone else thought of you. It wasn't until someone corrected you or you discovered it by yourself that you changed your behavior. Perhaps someone else knew it meant ""mentally disabled,"" but didn't know why we don't say it. Perhaps they thought it was cool to use as slang but didn't understand the connotations of it. I still remember when I was a kid when 'gay' was the 'cool' way to say something was weird or strange. In 2021, that's vile and pretty damn homophobic, to be honest. In 2005(ish?) it was normalized through the media that I watched, my friends, and what happened at my school, which was not in a very culturally diverse part of the country. It was normal. It was how we thought we should speak. 2021 queer me would never do it. It wasn't until I took on the task of reading and listening to other voices through twitter and tumblr around 2012/2013 that I began to unlearn concepts and that was *voluntary*. I did not sit in a classroom and get educated on homophobia beyond a very simplistic ""homophobia is bad, m'kay?"" I didn't learn about race riots or the fight to vote or police violence against black people or black culture or brown culture, or really much of anything apart from my own. Without exposure to people who had that experience, I wasn't taught it. Nobody sat me down and said, ""if you do this, it's racist/homophobic, and we don't do that anymore."" If I didn't take it upon myself to do my own research out of my own curiosity, or I had no incentive to go looking, why would I have changed my behavior and understood it? 

You said it yourself, there was a moment where you changed from ""ignorant"" to ""educated"" on that one issue. This is the problem for idols. Their 'ignorant' moment is very public, accessible to millions, and then they have to fix it in the public eye. And that's one issue. Because there's no formal system to 'educate' idols on this, they keep stumbling into moments where they have to 'learn' and every time, it's front and center stage. 

&gt; [...]it's no way near an excuse but today I'm not the same, I'm about to turn 19 and i educated myself a long time ago. i grew values and principles, i respect people and their culture. i learned. I'm not 20-25 doing/saying things a 8 uneducated year old would say. I'm not 26 mocking a culture a 10 uneducated year old would mock. I'm 18 and i learned and I'm still learning everyday. WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR KPOP IDOLS????

Because fans don't respect them as regular people. People are dumb. People are stupid. People are very self centered about how they view the world. People are not educated on multiple cultures around the world in all societies. For many people, nobody sits you down in class and teaches you about things like power structures, hierachies of power, the origins of White Supremacy, how internalized your own 'isms' are as a rule. People live in a little bubble where we just do our own thing and don't think about consequences because what we do/say is *normalized* to us. People carry with them internalized racism and sexism and homophobia from their own culture and we express it until someone goes, ""Hey, no, cut that shit out!"" or educates us on why it's not cool. The curry dance, using AAVE as your 'talent', cornrows as a 'style', dreads, being colourist about tan skin, a lot of that is normalized in Korea. It's what you know and grow up with. 

And what you have to remember is that for a lot of the shit we see, there's a whole heap of people who that clip or sound byte has passed through. It's gone through the idols, through their management, through production, and post production, and through sign off, and at every step, *nobody said shit* about it. *Every set of hands that clip passed through had a moment where they could say, ""hey, maybe not*. And yet, nobody did. So what does that tell us? Either idols are so immune to criticism from their company that they forced it through (unlikely) or that the ignorance on that issue is collective, not individual. 

&gt; same for khiphop artists, they idolize black African American culture so much, they want to be like us so bad. they ""respect"" the culture, they look up to black rappers. but if you admire so much this culture, why don't you educate yourself on the WHOLE culture, the good and the bad? 

South Korea imported rap as an aesthetic. They imported the look, the sound, the feel, as a ""thing"" you can put on and take off as easily as changing your hair from straight to cornrows and back again. Especially for men, rappers are the 'cool' members of the group, they have a 'tough' image, the chains and swagger and the conspicuous wealth is part of their 'rapper' collective identity. Guns and gun effects are used to increase the 'cool' factor of a music video. Is this okay? Nope. Is this acceptable? Definitely not. Does it explain why a lot of people behave the way they do around it? Kind of. In Korea, it seems to me to be that the culture didn't come with it. There's no weight to it, which is why people can do things like [this](https://www.nme.com/en_asia/news/tv/penthouse-actor-park-eun-seok-apologises-for-k-drama-character-slammed-by-viewers-as-racist-2970606) and nobody, not one person, objected to it when that man walked on set and said, ""this is how I'm going to do this."" 

&gt; this video is a great example on how you can use Google, educate yourself and educate people around you. there should be this class EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD. Trainees learn about cultural appropriation

I agree on this and I think it's a very good way to teaching trainees how to be kind and empathetic to all their fans. I also think it would help to reduce anxieties from black and brown fans around the world because it's just scandal after scandal to know that this kind of education is formalized and presented to everybody, rather than idols lurching from scandal to inappropriate comment to offensive stereotyping, and there's no comprehensive system that lets them figure it out before bad shit happens.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
499,"You are the troll that seems to be upset because im talking about the great america, Brazil is indeed dangerous, way more than the united states, im not talking about that, im talking about off-duty undercover cops, thats not a thing and yes, you are more likely to get shot by a cop or a random civilian in the US.

If you are not in the act of commiting a crime, or you are in a crime situation, there is 0% chance you will get shot, no cop will ever shot at a civilian, even if the civilian is going towards the cop in an aggresive way holding something and civilians dont walk around armed, no one has a gun, its really rare, im from Brazil and ive never seen an off duty cop acting. 

In America anyone might have a gun and that makes the cops way more on the edge and they have the authority to kill you and walk away.

On the other way, you are way more likely to get shot by a robber, murderer, convicted crime person, drug soldiers etc, in Brazil, but these guys are distinct from a random civilian, they will be dressed and acting like a criminal and they will not think twice about killing you, these are the guys you see in the footages. 

Off course that can still happen in Brazil, there are some cases but they become really notorious and there will be lots of repercussion if that happens. Cops really need great evidence when shooting someone, in the Favelas it may happen more often but will cause comotion anyway.

I was not saying that US is more dangerous than Brazil, its not, but our violence is a bit different, i find these reddit footages to be a little bit misleading. 

Its less that there are undercover cops everywhere, more that a high profile crime can happen anywhere.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
500,"&gt;We don’t have school Shootings here

Funny how you had to add the word ""school"" to try and make it true. New Zealand has NO PLACE in talking shit about places with gun violence, lmao. Oh.. and... no, it does not give you any perspective. You are not American and you know nothing of what it is like to live here or what people truly experience.

Also, you're straw manning and it's not even a good one. You're actually claiming we don't *care* about kids dying? Are you nuts? Of course we care. What we don't like are foreigners and anti-gun nuts exaggerating what actually goes on in our school system. School shootings, and especially mass shootings, are incredibly rare despite what news you see on reddit. 

Yes, America has a culture which supports firearms. That is our culture. We live that. It's okay for you not understand it because you are not American. But maybe sweep under your own rug before mindlessly arguing with a citizen of another country about their country and what their values must be.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
501,"Have you ever had to defend yourself with your own firearms? Do you like shooting at the range? I do its fun to shoot. Not so fun to live in your gun culture.

Criminals are WAY more likely to shoot you dead in america then they are in europe. In fact, you dont really get robbed at gun point in europe. Its just not worth it. Any crime here involving a gun is SO much more illegal that criminals dont see the worth in murder. (Psycopaths excluded) Added to that in europe a life sentence is like 25 years so the criminal is not gambling his whole life during a crime. Plus citizens not having guns makes criminals ALSO less likely to even have to carry a gun in the first place. 

You are just so desensitized to gun violence that you dont see it as an urgent problem to deal with. You are also all afraid of the inevitable ""change period"" where lawful citizen give up their arms while the police fights to confiscate all the illegal firearms. 

You know how we look at middle eastern countries where you cannot be LGBTQ+ and shake our heads and say ""yeah we dont do that anymore""? Thats you guys and guns. We just dont do that anymore. We value life and I am sorry but the only  useful purpose of a gun is to kill. Kill in the name of defending yourself or robiing or liberating. It doesnt fucking matter. We dont do that anymore inside of our own borders where our children walk to school and play in the parks. We just dont and thanks to that nobody dies from that. 

You CAN go to any european country and get a sport shooting license and go shoot in a range. The only place where shots should be fired. And when it DOES happen that somebody commits gun crime, its a HUGE TRAGEDY and not the fault of the victim for not owning a gun.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

504,"“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be [infringed](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-2/).”

[Additional Source](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/16/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/?amp=1). 

Also using statistics from 1968-2011 is extremely disingenuous and doesn’t show the full story. Most gun deaths that occur in the US are suicides. [60% of gun deaths in 2019 were from suicide and only 37% were from homicides](https://health.ucdavis.edu/what-you-can-do/facts.html). 

In America guns are used more to commit suicide rather than homicides. And also guns aren’t as prevalent as you think. The source also states that only 31% of American households have guns.

“Compared with other countries

The U.S. has relatively low rates of assaultive violence but high firearm mortality rates in comparison with other industrialized nations.4

Risk and safety

Research has found that individuals with risk factors for firearm injury and death are less likely to safely store their firearms when compared to firearm owners without these risk factors.5,6

Trends in firearm injury and death

Overall since 2006, firearm homicides in the U.S. have decreased, but the number of firearm suicides has increased by a similar amount.4

Even when firearm homicide rates were at their highest in the mid-1990s (just above 7/100,000 population), they were not higher than those for firearm suicide.”

But now we’re a little off-topic. Owning Guns is a right and since the amendment states that right “Shall not be infringed” any attempt to limit/block them is taking away rights.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
505,"Ok I dont know where to begin with the stupidity of your response.  I have been polite and holding back out of respect but what you just spewed is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen.

&gt;Again why are these restrictions necessary. Please explain why putting less voter booths in a mostly minority district makes sense when there are just as many voters there than in neighboring districts. 

&gt;We don't think that any restriction is them trying to block blacks from voting. We think that specifically limiting polling locations and throwing out ballots in black districts is an effort to keep blacks from voting. 

The reason there are less voting booths is to ensure integrity and Reduce the access points for the opportunity for fraud. You framing it as if this is going to stop black people from voting.  Think about it, Do you think you would honestly not  be able to vote in these states? I think you would have no issues.  Also voting booths have been removed all over the place, not just minority districts. Read the whole law again. 


&gt;CA is a better place to live in than most other states. The homeless here are shipped here from other states, so unless we build a wall around CA, other places will keep bussing their homeless here. Also the crime rate thing is another lie. GOP talks about crime all day, trying to scare people but the crime rate isn't really on the rise. There's no epidemic. It's another scare tactic that you're falling for.

Then answer this question. Why is Gavin Newsome getting recalled? California is a shithole and you know it.

&gt;You know who's really tired of COVID. People who are dying of it. It's killed over half a million people and if it were up to the GOP it would have killed so many more. I hate to talk about people like this but republicans are toxic to the country. They openly spread disease proudly and joke about being unvaccinated and unmasked. It's not a joke to people on ventilators in hospitals.

Maybe Covid is not as big of a deal as you think. I mean it does have 99 percent survival rate. Plus people are on ventalitors all the time. I mean thats why hospitals exist. To take care of people who are dying.

&gt;People had to wait in lines for hours in the rain to vote the last few elections because they limited the voting boots to a degree that that's what you have to do. Democrats are more realistic about the effect of voting. If all the candidates are kinda terrible, do I want to spend 6 hours in line to vote knowing nothing will change. Republicans are like soldiers they even showed up to vote for Roy Moore knowing he was a pedophile. Republicans hate Ted Cruiz and Mitch McConnell but they keep coming back because republicans like good soldiers will toe the line and vote every time. 

See thats a choice you made for yourself. Itnis not necessarily that your right to vote was being suppressed. If you truly cared then you would have waited the 6 hours. It shows how apathetic you are, and yes you have the right to not vote, just like you have the right to vote.  I told you this all about power. I have voted 2 elections. The issue is majority of the voters are not informed.beyond the media talking point and this goes for both GOP and Dems.  Trump was different from the GOP. He was a fuck you to the political establishment.


&gt;southern states have passed laws against teaching CRT even though they're not even teaching it in those schools. It's all show. It's a song and dance to keep their voters in line. They banned something that isnt' even happening. A teacher in Tennessee was fired for mentioning slavery. texas didnt' start discussing slavery in school until 2018. Idaho mentions slavery must be mentioned only twice in the entire K - 12 school system. 

&gt;It's no wonder they don't understand CRT. They don't understand history. They don't know anything about what's happened in this country. It's brainwashing.

And teaching 5-6 year old kids that if you are white, you are privilege and if you are a minority, you oppressed is not brainwashing? Look this what I am against. Just teach kids math and science and reason and equip them with the tools to succeed in the free market. Hell I dont think public education should even be a thing.  Post the article of the Tennessee teacher getting fired.

&gt;It's a boogie man, because that's what the GOP runs on. Remember when Obama was supposed to take our guns. Remember the migrant caravan. Remember when Obama was a secret Muslim who was going to input sharia law? Remember when AOC was going to ban hamburgers? Remember when COVID was a liberal hoax and the vaccine was going to kill people. Remember when liberals were going to fight a war on Christmas and have it banned? Remember when the gay agenda was going to make all of our kids gay? Remeber how the trasn agenda was going to make all of our kids trans? Remember how 3 million people voted illegally in 2016 and trump was going to get to the bottom of it? Remember how the Benghazi? Remember how crime is somehow on the rise, yet they don't have any statistics to prove it but they just FEEL like it's on the rise? Remember when BLM has completely defunded your police departments and now there's cities with no police? And now remember how the GOP told you that CRT, an advanced theory really only taught in colleges, was going to make your kindergartener hate themselves for being white?

Didnt Dwayne Wade trans his kid to ""show he is an ally""? Like to me thats child abuse. Some of the stuff you said I am not sure about, but BLM was for defunding the police. How about this lets ban Anti Racism in school because Anti Racism is racism. In the words of Ibram X Kendi, ""the cure for past discrimination is present discriminaation and the cure for present discrimination is future discrimination"". Do you really want a soceity of discrimination And CRT is not being taught in school then you should not have a problem with it being banned.

Also there are Gun Control laws being passed that should not even be passed.  An armed society is a free society because you will able to defend yourself. Think of it this way say you and I are armed. I am less likely to mess with you because that effort could end up getting me harmed. Through us being armed the non aggression principle remains in tact.  I think we all should be armed especially with police being defunded.

Also one more thing a free society is not a safe one. Once you understand that, all my positions become clear to you.

&gt;Again the democrats are TERRIBLE. I think they're awful at their job and only want to maintain the status quo. But the GOP and the lies they push are dangerous for America. They're determined to make it a much worse place for everyone who isn't them.



I think they are both Terrible. But the GOP is not in control of the institutions, hollywood and the media. The Dems and it seems you are still stuck there.

&gt;Colorblindness isn't a tool its a weapon. Again I go back to my example of domestic violence. If a man beats his wife every day. And when the police come, instead of saying he's beating her we just keep saying ""let's not use blaming language, we'll just say punches were thrown."" Then nothing happens. People throw their hands in the air and say ""whaddya gonna do"" 

This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. When Domestic abuse happen you hold the guilty party accountable and thats that. You truly dont understand individualism.  It mean your race is not the most important thing about you and while others may proceed to judge people on race you proceed to treat people as individuals. You treat them on who they are as people, good and bad.  Jacob Blake is the perfect case for this.  People feel sorry for the guy because he is black, I dont because he was abusing a woman and was about to kidnap children if the cops did not intervene.

Dont be afraid of the racists. They dont have power over you like you think.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They believe that methods used in the 1970s and 1980s will get us far today and ""encourage"" kids to live in a nationalistic America - meanwhile, thousands of children as still and are becoming traumatized from school shootings and other acts of violence due to their gun rights.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heres the thing though. If you watch these videos the antifa people are throwing fireworks at the proudboys. So the proud boys feel justified holding guns and feeling like they are keeping peace somehow. There's a strange mixture of black people with the proud boys which is strange but I think it's more people that think guns are good and solve problems because they saw too many movies.

What I see is two sides desperate for identity and willing to resort to violence because they don't understand their tribal instincts.

I would not be surprised at all if there's a kind of civil war in America in 10 years or less. Only the people dipping out of society all together will get through because both sides are just stupid tribes trying to fix a problem both are facing because of a corrupt government and rampant capitalism destroying what used to be known as the American dream.  We have no real leaders any more and the bottom is gonna to slowly start fighting each other because they don't understand who the real enemy is.

This is sad to see and both sides in my eyes are failures.  

The way these comments look I feel kind of hopeless in general for America. Everyone just wants to look at the top layer of something. Pick their side and feel superior. Absolutely no desire to look deeper.

Unless there is a massive change in American leadership outside of typical democrat or republican leadership there will be a civil war.  These people are upset because the system is fucking everyone who's not at the top of it out of a decent life.  There is no more American dream. Only maximum profit for corporations.  

I lived in London for the last couple of years and watched the value of the dollar dwindle compared to the pound. Maybe when you live there you don't feel it as much.  But unless there is a system put in place to help the people at the bottom regardless of race or gender expect a lot more violence",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

510,"Thanks for the response and your patience. Kittens have been fully wrestled and fed - and I got some sleep! Photos of kittens available upon request.

I think the area you focused on is a good point of discussion - and branches into a few areas. I'll try not to point-by-point you, but will organize my response into some categorical areas. 

I want to do one point, since it doesn't come up in the rest of my response, and that is ""there were no guns on 1/6."" We don't know that. Best we can say is that no Trump supporters were filmed with guns and no shots were fired. One of the officers who testified recently said he saw what he assumed was the outline of a gun when an off-duty police officer flashed his badge at him. Almost no one was arrested on-site at the capitol. We also know that the Oath Keepers had a plan to rush weapons in. And, you can make the argument that many/most of Trump's supporters believed that the police and military were going to flip, so they wouldn't need guns. We need to investigate more.

I also want to caveat that there will, almost certainly, be individual counter-examples to virtually anything I say. Parties are big and don't control what every politician, opinion writer, pundit, operative, family member, etc. says or does. I'm trying not to take the ""aha, but Ted Cruz one time said the opposite of that, so..."" approach to your points - and am instead focusing on broad trends. When I use an example, such as Hannity or Frum, it's that they are representative of many examples. 


**Executive Summary**

You make a passionate and evocative case. I appreciate it. Almost universally, my responses keep drifting back to ""you're getting information from unreliable sources."" It's a problem, because what I consider unreliable sources (Trump, ""Trump Republicans,"" Fox News [except the hard news team], OAN/Newsmax, Qanon) all start by saying that reliable sources are unreliable. Not that your conclusions are illogical or bad, but that the premises you're building on aren't doing much work for you. 

To give one example: The characterization of Trump *""as an otherwise decent (if admittedly pugnacious and rather immature toxic man-child of a) President of the United States""* That is a description of Trump you will *only* hear on the right. He is a serial adulterer, multiply-alleged harasser/rapist, overt racist, potential white supremacist, twice-impeached, pandemic-denying, coup-attempting... I could go on. 

We don't need to debate that. We have fundamentally different views of Trump. His defenders/attackers are driving discourse, because he is intentionally dividing our country for his benefit. 


**Right by Any Means**

It's worth noting that, until the late 90s or early 10s, depending on your orthodoxy, liberals viewed conservatives with much less derision. Not zero... but much less. I think the gloves fully came off with Garland. That was such an overt ""we'll cheat to win"" from the GOP. 

At every point, you see the media criticizing Democrats for not going far enough, for Pollyanna-ing, for bringing a bleeding heart to a gun fight. Why not abolish the filibuster? Pack the court? Why not investigate Bush for torture and war crimes? 

The rhetoric from the left may get sharp, but the actions of the party don't match.  

The argument that it is praiseworthy - by any means - to prevent conservatives from having power because ""they're inherently evil"" is not a common liberal argument, it is a refrain Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, and Laura Ingraham sing. It is a kind of rhetoric designed to provoke a ""last stand"" response. ""They are coming and they won't stop coming until you are dead"" is what ISIS or Hamas tells children to get them to put a bomb on their body. 

To say that the 2020 protests about police brutality were ""a literal fascist takeover of American politics"" is a fear-based argument. It's the argument Fox gave. Those protesters weren't trying to overthrow the government. They were demanding that, after hundreds of years of killing Black people, we try something else. I know there's a lot wrapped up in this, but hopefully the image of Emmett Till, Rodney King, George Floyd and the thousands of others, named and unnamed, can be understood to be a non-political, life-or-death issue for a substantial minority in our country.

To look at it another way, I've been to countries at war (as a civilian). I've been through and to protests in America. Where I grew up, we had violent Rodney King protests. They came within a few blocks of our apartment. I walked through Occupy Wall Street. BLM protesters walked down our street more than one time (and we had violence/tear gas/arrests a couple miles away). 

At war, there were blackouts every day, even during the cease fire. There was rationing. Armed men in the streets and alarms. Anti-aircraft guns on rooftops. Crumbled buildings in the middle of the town. My uncle missing an arm. So many dead that there were funerals (even in the cease fire) almost nonstop. 

The worst images of the 2020 protests, while deplorable, were not the war zone being conjured on the news. 

 

**How Trump Fits In**


By the election, there was a moral imperative to stop Trump by any **legal** means necessary. That was a response to everything that he was doing, of which we are still getting details. He is an amoral scumbag. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died because he refused to lead. He was actively undoing our democracy while praising dictators. He ended up trying to overthrow the government. Even DAVID FRUM, once a conservative lion, now a RINO I guess, says there can be no forgiveness for that.

We wouldn't even be talking about election fraud if not for Trump. We've never talked about election fraud as a major issue before. Bush/Gore wasn't fraud. It was just a close race. Trump even claimed he won the popular vote in 2016. He started a voter fraud committee in 2017 to investigate fraud in the election HE WON. Of course they found none. Just like 2020.

Trump has poisoned the country. 
 

**Threat of Violence**

You ask ""how many people voted for Biden because they were scared of what the radical left would do to the country if Trump won again?"" I'd ask ""how many people voted for Biden because they were scared of what Trump would do to the country if he won again?""

To answer your question, I really have no idea how many people voted out of fear, but we know for sure that people were highly motivated to vote in 2020. I know that I was afraid of a Trump re-election being the end of democracy in our country. Conservatives would probably say that's ridiculous, but after four years of watching Trump try to imitate Putin and Erdogan, I didn't think it was irrational. 1/6 was a vindication of that worry. 

I wouldn't blame anyone who watches Fox News for being afraid that Antifa was going to kill you, or BLM was an insurgency, or any number of other things. I watch a lot of Fox. 

If Trump had won, I'd guess there would have been massive protests, violence, crackdowns, and possibly a general strike. Trump had been broadcasting his plans to rig the election for MONTHS in any way possible. He was blackmailing Ukraine, trying to rush the vaccine, literally dismantling the post office, Hunter Biden's laptop, etc. It felt like the fix was in - and if the election had gone Trump's way, that would just be proof that his authoritarian style was working. 

I mean, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - a role that most Americans could name, maybe, one person who has occupied - was openly preparing for a coup.

If anything I think this motivated record turnout. Republicans were hearing it was going to be a slaughter. Democrats were gearing up for mass civil action. In 2021, you needed to be standing somewhere.



 **The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election**

I cannot believe Time went with that super-clickbaity headline. It sounds SO EVIL. Fox News had it up almost as soon as it was published. ""See? The liberal media is bragging about stealing the election!"" Time probably wanted that for traffic.

This is the key paragraph about what they did: *""They got states to change voting systems and laws and helped secure hundreds of millions in public and private funding. They fended off voter-suppression lawsuits, recruited armies of poll workers and got millions of people to vote by mail for the first time. They successfully pressured social media companies to take a harder line against disinformation and used data-driven strategies to fight viral smears. They executed national public-awareness campaigns that helped Americans understand how the vote count would unfold over days or weeks, preventing Trump’s conspiracy theories and false claims of victory from getting more traction. After Election Day, they monitored every pressure point to ensure that Trump could not overturn the result. “The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation,” says Norm Eisen, a prominent lawyer and former Obama Administration official who recruited Republicans and Democrats to the board of the Voter Protection Program.""*

That doesn't sound illegal or unethical to me. But on Fox, it was presented differently.

If you read the article, those guys saw every stage of what Trump planned to do, all the way to 1/6. They even encouraged Democrats to stay away so that they couldn't be blamed for any violence coming out of the rally or give Trump a final excuse to use the Insurrection Act.

It is not illegal to get an abortion in Texas. Do you really think that you're going to get pregnant while vacationing in Texas and then you'll have to get an abortion in America before you get back to your home country? Do you know how dumb that sounds?

I've spent a lot of time all over Europe. I know what it costs to eat in most countries. Lets assume you go all out and spend $100/day to dine out in the U.S. Now lets add 15% tip to that cost. If you stay for 10 days that's $150. If $150 in tips is keeping you from visiting the U.S., you probably shouldn't be coming in the first place.

Oh the gun thing! That's always fun to talk about. I live in a state where people have the right to carry a gun legally. In my 40 years of living here, besides cops and security guards, I've not seen one person carrying a gun. Do you know how many times I've seen a shooting? Zero. Do you know how many people I've known who have been shot? Zero. What foreigners and many U.S. citizens fail to realize is that the majority of gun violence happens in 1% of the U.S. and they are not places where tourists hang out.

As far as medical emergencies, of course I've thought it out. I think it out every time I leave the country. Just like the other 90% of Americans, I know that I have health insurance that will cover me regardless of which country I go to. Does the health coverage you have not extend to other countries? How would you go bankrupt in your own country while vacationing in the U.S.. Do you think that hospitals in the U.S. just lock people in prisons until they can pay? 

I'm totally fine with you not wanting to visit the United States but most of your reasons for not wanting to visit are idiotic.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
512,"The problem in this country as I see it is that we have a [long list of large-cap companies in this country that rely on DoD contracts for the vast majority of their annual revenue, which is in the tens of billions of dollars for many of these companies.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defense_contractors#List_of_defense_contractors_by_arm_sales) Since these companies do not profit by selling a product to the general public, they allocate resources that other companies use for marketing/branding/commercials to lobbying politicians in D.C.  And, because of Super PACs, there is no limit to the amount of money that one individual or one corporation can donate, and then you add the fact that they are all-but excepting outright bribes in the form of ""speaking gigs"" and donations to the ""charitable"" foundation/money-washers that they all have now, and you end up with the situation we have now with rampant corruption, where these law-makers are being paid huge sums of money and getting incredibly wealthy while in office, or immediately after their terms are up, and they are being paid to enact legislation that serves the best interests of the people paying them this money, as opposed to their constituents that they are supposed to be representing.  You are probably well aware of the fact that we have an inverted tax system where the majority of working people pay a huge percentage of their income in taxes (cigarette taxes, gas taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes) because they end up spending all of their income, whereas wealthy people stash their money in hedge funds and off-shore accounts and they get the capital gains rate and all that, so we have the burden of financing the entire federal Government put on a dwindling middle class that is seeing more jobs automated or outsourced and to top it all, we don't get jack squat back for paying all those taxes.  Almost all developed countries give their citizens healthcare, for instance, most have decriminalized drug use, many countries give youth a stipend to pay for schooling and such, but here in America we get jails and prisons built for our money.  They talk about gun violence a lot in liberal media, but the facts are that a young urban male is far more likely to be jailed on a gun charge (that he may not even know he is violating because of the inconsistency and complexity of gun laws) than he is to be shot.  Every year there is less and less federal grant money for the NSF, they are cutting services left and right, and yet the politicians are spending money that hasn't even been printed yet, in the TRILLIONS of dollars.  So where the heck is this money going? It's mostly going to the Pentagon and the DoD and all [the 20 or so different intelligence agencies that are hard at work keeping us safe.](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7566&amp;context=jclc)

And so you have these very same people that are paying off the politicians are now buying up media outlets.  Kyle for instance, works for Jeffrey Katzenberg, a multi-billionaire Disney mogul.  And the message they are pushing is DIVIDE AND CONQUER. Because they saw what happened and 2016, and they know well enough *THAT THE BERNIE SANDERS CROWD AND THE DONALD TRUMP CROWD HAVE THE SAME ECONOMIC INTERESTS AND THE WANT THE SAME POLICY SOLUTIONS.*  Trumps greatest asset was that he was living Bernie's core message: Winning the election, or at least the the primary, without a single dollar of SUPER PAC money.  They also know that their is not a lot of cultural overlap between these two groups of people, so they push people inward into their little bubbles, hence the censoring of ""misinforation"" and why some sub-reddits have become such worthless echo chambers. I don't get why people see any value in talking to similar people who share their same exact beliefs and opinions.  You only reinforce your own ignorance and you cannot learn anything new.  It's a waste of time.  My biggest problem with Kyle's show is that he puts out so many videos just ripping on some conservative pundit and ridiculing and mocking some very bad example of a conservative.  This is straight out of the oligarchy playbook, page 1.  It accomplishes very little other than distracting people on the ""left"" from the fact that they are not holding their own elected officials accountable, and these elected democrats are not fulfilling ANY of their campaign promises, but it also serves to make people too afraid of the other side to ever hold their own side accountable (in the only we can, by voting elected officials OUT OF OFFICE, because you have to vote R to get rid of a D and visa versa), and it also makes insecure people too afraid to stand out and be different from their peer group, so they cling to meaningless labels like ""Democrat"" or ""Republican.""  If you follow politics long enough, you will realize that the Democrats are just playing the ""good cop"" or the ""white hat cowboy"" in the great farce that is American Politics, and that the last thing you have to fear is voting for a red tie, instead of a blue tie, because money talks and at the end of the day, they are all taking the bribes.  Pelosi or McConnell, blue or red, it doesn't make zero bit of difference to Northrop Grumman, and it shouldn't to you or me either because not a single one of them gives even a single fuck about either one of us or anyone else without a few hundred thousand or more in donations, for that matter.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The difference in the rate of gun violence in america isn't about access; anyone who wants to get an illegal gun can with enough money in basically every country.

By tying the fetishization of armed authority to the imagery of patriotism, violence as a solution to any and every problem has been ingrained in our culture. Every issue the govt has, they send cops or military to use violence to get their way.

527,"&gt;Or, to look at this another way, we are told not to kill in the Bible, yet some of the most robust conservative Christian circles in America are obsessed with the military and gun culture.

That is because they are mixing American nationalism (usually the case with Right-wing conservatives) with Christianity, both of which are incompatible with each other.

Christ's Kingdom is not of this world and we do not operate on physical violence even if it is legal in the eyes of the law.

Thing is, God has given the government dominion over us and Romans 13 tells us to follow the laws of the land. But not above God's word. These people think because it's in the constitution to bear arms, they feel more justified in carrying their guns.

As for the militaristic culture, the conclusion is the same with mixing Christianity with American Nationalism. They think they're honoring God like this. Again, like I said before, God has given power and authority to governments including the military, but that is only be used for righteous purposes such as protecting peace, law and order. If you commit a crime, the authorities are gonna come after you and that is because God has set it up that way. Whatever punishment you receive from the courts is God's judgment.

Military is meant for peacekeeping purposes. However, some Americans love to boast about how strong their military is. Some are just straight bloodthirsty people who love war and violence, partially because they like power and control. War is not of God. God has reserved the killing of evil people to the authorities, not us.

Much of it comes from pride, arrogance and idolatry. They idolize American through their patriotism/nationalism when they take it too far. Their arrogance could be birthed from their right to bear arms and their powerful military.

However, my conclusion is that when ungodly people are put in charge and when a nation forgets God, bad things happen. I believe it's partially because of the right how gun laws work (or how they fail depending on your perspective) why shootings and mass shootings in the US are out of control. 

[An Insider article tells us that over 140 people were killed in shootings across the US alone.](https://www.insider.com/mass-shootings-in-us-over-fourth-of-july-weekend-2021-7)

That alone should say something along with the countless other mass shootings in the country. It's nearly impossible to go even a month without hearing about at least one mass shooting in the US.

I believe the the right to bear arms is actually a curse. Humans are sinful and even if guns are legal, we can't be trusted to use them in a legal and safe way. 

These Christians love their country and rights more than God and His command to love Him with everything and love your neighbor. I believe that the only ones who should carry guns are law enforcement officials and the military for peacekeeping and law and order purposes.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the Republican Party loses its grip on national power and goes nuclear with its cultural war, Tennessee has become a test lab for a new kind of crazy.

Updated Jul. 17, 2021 10:42AM ET 
Published Jul. 16, 2021 11:50PM ET 
Nihilistic Tennessee Republicans, committed to advancing the most restrictive anti-abortion laws including a bill that forces the burial or cremation of surgically aborted fetuses, have stopped the state’s vaccination outreach to minors.

As the Delta variant spreads across America, with all 50 states reporting an increase in COVID-19 cases, the Tennessee Department of Health succumbed to immense pressure from Republican state lawmakers to help infect as many young people as possible. Tennessee announced it was halting all of its adolescent vaccine outreach even as the rate of coronavirus infections in the state has tripled in the past three weeks. Not just COVID-19 vaccines, mind you, but for polio, hepatitis, rubella and all vaccines.

Advertisement
This news was celebrated by measles, which is currently trying hard to make a successful comeback due to an increase in worldwide vaccine hesitancy, a top 10 global health threat, according to WHO.

In addition to stopping all COVID-19 vaccine events at schools, Tennessee will stop sending postcards and notices reminding teenagers to receive their second shot. The state’s top immunization leader, Dr. Michelle Fiscus, was fired after she sent a memo reiterating state policy that some teenagers can be vaccinated without parental consent. She received death threats and was sent a muzzle.

It seems the death rattle of white supremacy has transformed the GOP and its conservative base into a raging death cult. They are willing to sacrifice their own children as collateral damage in their culture wars while further radicalizing their base against science and vaccines. This represents their desperate attempt to hold on to the fading power of a conservative white Christian minority, whose anxiety makes vaccines, masks, and racial equality into terrifying dragons in need of vanquishing by self-proclaimed knights. These Don Quixotes in expensive suits and cowboy boots spend their time fighting windmills instead of a pandemic, climate change, gun violence and poverty.

The vaccine outreach ban isn’t the only way Republican lawmakers in the former Confederate state have worked to save kids, if by “save kids” you mean use the state as a test lab for the increasingly extreme measures Republicans hope to implement on a national level to ensure their ideological agenda and minority rule. After all, Tennessee was the site of the famous Scopes “Monkey Trial” where John Scopes was initially found guilty and fined for violating the Butler Act that banned the teaching of evolution. It’s only fitting that the state has now banned critical race theory to ensure, according to Governor Bill Lee, that they teach kids “the exceptionalism of our nation and how people can live together and work together to make a greater nation.”

What better way of bringing America together as it’s attempting to repair its awful history of racism than a state—that fought to save the barbaric institution of slavery—pulling funding from teachers who want to educate children about white supremacy and systemic racism? Similar proposals, pushed by right-wing groups and mainstreamed by Fox News, have now been introduced in 16 states.

Tennessee was also one of the battleground states where conservative activists promoted the manufactured anti-sharia threat, which created the template being used now to promote anti-CRT measures across the country. For years, these right-wing forces tried to stop the expansion of a Murfreesboro mosque to test their goal of “proving” that Islam somehow isn’t a religion, and as such deny Muslims protections and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. In 2014, the Supreme Court declined to hear the right-wing activists’ case, thereby ending the fiasco. But that didn’t stop Tennessee from joining five other red states in passing copycat “anti-Islamic and anti-terrorism measures” written and promoted by the same hateful organizations.

In order to save the kids, Tennessee is usually at the forefront of extremist anti-abortion bills. Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers introduced one that would give fathers the legal right to stop a woman they’d impregnated from ending that pregnancy. Along with 19 other states, Tennessee is supporting South Carolina’s anti-abortion law that forbids doctors from performing abortions if they can detect a heartbeat in a fetus, which can happen before a women even knows that she’s pregnant. Buoyed by a 6-3 right-wing Supreme Court, more abortion restrictions have been enacted this year than any other year, with Republican state legislatures passing at least 90 restrictive laws in 2021 alone.

Of course, that pro-life sentiment doesn’t extend to gun control, despite the prevalence of mass shootings terrorizing our schools across the country. As of July 1, Tennessee is officially one of 19 states that allows permitless gun carry. What better way of saving children than allowing most adults to carry and conceal a handgun without so much as a permit? This was a top legislative agenda for Gov. Lee during a crippling pandemic and recession. In the past 10 years, Tennessee’s rate of gun deaths has increased 28 percent. The state’s rates of homicides, firearm deaths, drug overdose deaths, and infant mortality rates are higher than the national average, so naturally Lee and Tennessee Republicans signed a Medicaid block grant this year and have tried and failed to repeal Obamacare.

Who needs vaccines and health care when Tennesseans can shoot away coronavirus and heart disease with a Glock 9?

The road to stupid is currently being led by Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn, one of the shining intellectuals of the right wing. She keeps stunning us with gems, whether it’s her climate-change denialism, her belief that universal daycare is Soviet propaganda, her ongoing feud with Taylor Swift, her failed Twitter polls, or her vigorous and spirited defense of “Neanderthal thinking.” If only she cared about protecting her constituents as much as she did about defending the honor of our extinct ancestors, then maybe Tennessee would have more than 38 percent of its population vaccinated.

But Blackburn, who is vaccinated, is just another proud soldier in the Trumpian death cult, along with the likes of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. He responded to rising COVID cases in his state by selling “Don’t Fauci my Florida” gear. More than 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. last month were among unvaccinated people, but that didn’t stop the crowd at the recent CPAC conference in Dallas from cheering the news about low vaccination rates. A Newsmax host recently made a case for genocidal Social Darwinism when he said that vaccines are “against nature” and some diseases should wipe people out. He didn’t mention if his family and loved ones were to be included in that sacrifice.

“In the Upside Down, violent insurrectionists like Ashli Babbitt are martyrs, murderers like Kyle Rittenhouse are victims, war criminals like Eddie Gallagher are heroes, and selfish, hedonistic vulgarians like Donald Trump are flawed instruments chosen by God to do his will. ”
The GOP’s embrace of self-immolation should surprise no one considering their Chosen One is Donald Trump, who won the election thanks to the cultural and racial anxieties of voters concerned with their perceived loss of power. Robert Jones, head of Public Religion Research Institute, told me the cultural fears of conservative white Christians, who make up 68% of the GOP, “reveal the inner fears of a former majority who are losing their sense of ownership of the country.”

Right-wing media is able to manipulate these fears, promote disinformation, and create tangible targets, manufacturing enemies who serve as pinatas for white rage, frustration and pain. In the past it was the caravans of immigrants, earlier this year it was cancel culture, and now it’s CRT and vaccines. All are allegedly instruments of the left supposedly out to trash the Constitution and replace it with godless Marxist Sharia Communism that will force conservatives to pray to Mecca and stop using gender pronouns.

In the Upside Down, violent insurrectionists like Ashli Babbitt are martyrs, murderers like Kyle Rittenhouse are victims, war criminals like Eddie Gallagher are heroes, and selfish, hedonistic vulgarians like Donald Trump are flawed instruments chosen by God to do his will. Vaccines and masks are symbols and objects of tyranny, a means by the left to impose their oppressive agenda by using vaccination efforts to go “door to door” and, according to Rep. Madison Cawthorn, take away conservatives’ guns and bibles.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a scholar on authoritarianism who warned early on that Trump would abuse his powers to maintain his rule, told me the GOP has become the “pro-death party” with their embrace of lethal weapons, violent threats against public health officials, and rejection of vaccines. “No matter how many children and Republicans die, they must keep on this course,” she said.

Meanwhile, the majority keeps trying to give Republicans water to douse the flames, attempting to save them from their burning house that they voluntarily set on fire. As they remain trapped behind the collapsing walls and rising smoke, I fear they will instead embrace death with a smile, proud of their martyrdom, deluded in their belief that as they met their end they were at the very least able to own the libs.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Walking into a routine traffic stop with a loaded gun is tantamount to manslaughter. Any reasonable person would expect violence to be an outcome because one party intentionally brought a weapon to a non-violent confrontation.

530,"Good lord, I don't thin a single centimeter of my point made it past your skull. My complaint, essentially, is that libertarians have a tendency to hijack any conversation and attempt to forcefully bring it back to the dozen or so sound-bytes you guys fixate on. And what do you do? You *immediately* dive headfirst into the *exact same* libertarian spiel we've *all* heard a billion goddamn times before.

&gt; There's really not much more to say,

ye, that's my fucking problem, my good man! that's *exactly* what I was talking about. one of them anyway; i don't think you even realize what my other one was. You guys almost never have anything to say beyond the ""gubmit bad"" stump speech. you guys have no interest in actually addressing the problems society face; only in asserting your ideology, which frankly you don't even bother in substantiating most of the time! that's why people don't like you guys. any society problem people bring to you is invariably met with ""we don't care about the problem, only about gubmit bad."" -- that's exactly what you did in this thread, which prompted my tirade. never offering solutions, only criticism of other people's ideas. in that narrow sense, y'all are exactly like republicans.

but it *doesn't have to be this way.*

&gt; libertarians would do themselves a lot of favors if they struck at the root of society's *cultural* problems rather than flinging shit from the sidelines.

Remember when I said ""The price of freedom is personal responsibility""? That was me, frankly, trying to teach you how to libertarian with people properly. The truth is that a loooot of problems and ""problems"" in America could be solved if our culture wasn't so... self-indulgent. Am I wrong? The reason Vermonters have never really cared about restricting gun rights, despite their heavy liberalism, is because Vermonters have cultivated a culture of responsibility around gun ownership, in strong contrast to much of the rest of the country. The reason Scott dropped all covid19 restrictions? Again; our cultural sense of responsibility propelled most of us to get vaccinated. Our mountains are green and beautiful because we value them as a people. We rank top in education because we value education moreso than we fund education (although the two are obviously related). Our culture of sustainability and support for small businesses make Vermont great. 

Libertarians preach gubmit bad 'til the cows come home but don't have an equal vigor in preaching responsibility. And that's bad. Freedom without responsibility isn't freedom; it's just chaos. If society won't accept the consequences of some problem, i.e rampant gun violence, you ***need*** to offer something more than just ""gubmit bad gubmit bad gubmit bad"".  

throughout the pandemic, libertarians should've been screaming from the rooftops responsible behavior, like social distancing, wearing masks, &amp; getting vaccinated. but i only heard whispers from libertarians... which is admittedly much better than what I heard from republicans.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You have social, political, and economic tools to utilize for that since those are what the state understands. 
What it IS effective against are the state’s proxies and the natural local threats that arise in instances of unrest.

It will protect me from Pinkertons and Y’all Qaeda militias that think my area would make a great addition to their burgeoning Christian nationalist theocratic fiefdom.

[Source](https://www.maciverinstitute.com/2021/04/debunking-every-major-myth-about-mass-shootings-in-america/)

Myth 2: Mass shootings happen all the time in America

As a result of this, the public is led to believe that random incidents of mass murder happen all the time in America.  So far in 2021, the Gun Violence Archive has recorded 156 incidents that it defines as “mass shootings.”

Just 12, though, meet the FBI’s definition of a “mass murder.”  At least seven of them were domestic violence incidents, and just five are included in the Washington Post database as traditional “mass killing” incidents.

In 70 of the Gun Violence Archive’s 156 mass shootings, a full 45%, no one was killed.  In 118 of them (76%), either no one or one person was killed.  Just three percent (five out of 156) meet the commonly understood definition of a “mass killing.”

The Gun Violence Archive’s database is valuable as a tool for statistical analysis, but when politicians or members of the media cite it to make the point that “mass shootings happen every day in America,” they confuse the public into believing that the overwhelming majority of these incidents are not domestic violence or gang-related shootouts that kill or injure innocent bystanders as well as the intended targets.

In reality, most are.  This is not to say that any of them are in any way acceptable, but it is simply not true to suggest that one might die simply by going to the mall.  Researchers in 2015 examined each one of the 358 mass shooting incidents in the Gun Violence Archive’s database that year and found that two-thirds of them were either gang-related or resulted from arguments between groups of people—many of whom were drunk or high.

Another 11% of the mass shooting incidents were domestic violence-related, resulting in a full 31% of all deaths in mass shootings that year.  A substantial number of the remaining 24% of mass shooting incidents were robbery-related or committed in the commission of some other crime in high-crime areas of major or mid-sized cities.  A staggering 90% of all mass shootings occurred in areas with higher-than-average poverty rates.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
535,"Everyone is a law abiding citizen... until they're not.

It's kind of a slippery slope, because if only law abiding citizens follow laws, isn't it pointless to have laws if all laws only affect those that follow them? I find the ""gun laws hurt law abiding gun owners"" argument extremely dishonest. America clearly has an epidemic of gun violence, and there are people still trying to make the case that regular citizens owning several weapons is necessary for home defense. Sure, you can say that owning guns keeps your family protected from violent people, but strength invites challenge- even if that strength is entirely based upon owning a weapon.We can address all those things AND deal with the gun problem here.

Almost everything else you've listed is just politics, and ultimately not as bad as you think.

&gt;unsalvageable political polarization

We did this to ourselves in the span of about two decades. We can undo it with the loss of the GOP.

&gt;our undying reliance fossil fuels

American carbon emissions are falling, and were falling pre-pandemic. We'll probably never be completely free of fossil fuels, but there's political will for replacing decommissioned plants with nuclear or renewable options. Plus, there's market demand for electric cars that will only need moderate public resources to support it. Once the big public needs are addressed, market forces can take over and handle the manufacturing needs for particular fossil fuels.

&gt;to the mental health/healthcare crisis

Public healthcare is a solved problem, and the US will get there eventually. Even today, Obamacare is a huge improvement over what used to be.

Mental health is a trickier one. I could fill a book with how modern society is terrible for mental health, why our current approach isn't working, and ideas on what we could do different, but that's way too nuanced for a bullet point in an already long comment. I don't think this alone will be our downfall, though.

&gt;to gun violence

It's honestly not that bad. It's worse than it needs to be, and we should improve the things that are in our power to improve, but this doesn't even rise to the level of pretending to threaten society at large. The injury and death rates are on par with traffic-related injuries and deaths. Subsidies for unhealthy food is a much bigger public health risk than guns, and that's something that can be fixed in just a few years.

&gt;Seems like we are all worse off financially, mentally and physically.

I don't want to downplay this one in the sea of minor points. You're not wrong. It's harder to make ends meet. We're getting less healthy. We're definitely making less healthy social and emotional choices.

Most of these aren't intractable social problems, though. We can't pull ourselves up by the bootstraps and fix the political climate in America. That's just going to suck for another 15-30 years. We as individuals can absolutely make better choices in all of those areas. In this case, the system isn't all that rigged. Sure, it's easier to hop on your favorite social media site with endless scrolling, have Doordash bring you some food, and do it all again tomorrow. The cost of living is rising, but the ability to access the tools of the wealthy to compound your savings is better now than ever before in history. Air quality is better than it has been in a long time and we have more public land and green space than we did even when I was a kid, so get outside and put your feet in some grass. Everyone is desperate for real human interaction, so make the first move and rebuild your circle of friends. Even if we fix the politics, these are choices you're going to have to make for yourself.

&gt; That is despite the fact that the lack of border control makes many of those laws much less effective.

Ah, so you agree that strict gun control empowers criminals because they know they won’t be shot back at. Glad we agree on that.

You haven’t really proved anything. You’ve Cherry picked and selected a bunch of random data points without any statistical analysis or evidence of correlation.

545,"Gary IN is legitimately the most frightening place in America. Its a REALLY rough city. As far as alarming shit that happened. Drivers were very aggressive. I stopped at a red light and was off to the right and this SUV behind me had people hanging out the windows yelling that they were going to beat my ass and “fucking kill” me if i didnt get out of their way. I had nowhere to go further off the side of the road so… Normally this wouldnt register with me in a normal circumstance but their tone and just how insanely unhinged they seemed made me believe it.  I definitely believe they were armed, it was just obvious. 

I was swerved at and cut off multiple times in that city. It was actually surprising. I only rode through it… we are talking a couple hours of riding in Gary and there was maybe a half dozen instances of road rage i encountered on top of the regular reckless driving.

Then on the north side of gary after i thought i was through most of it i stopped because i absolutely needed water and a moment. I locked my bike next to a gas pump and walked toward the door of a gas station and this really sketch dude walks out of the gas station and looks at me and half laughs and says “ youre the wrong kinda person in the wrong kinda place” and made a shooing gesture towards me. So i turned around and got back on my bike and left. 

Going into IL and south chicago from Gary you will likely ride through a very industrial area (if you take the same route i did). There are lots of petroleum and soap processing facilities and the air either smells like a dish washer or burning metal. Either way i lost years of my life breathing that air. After that you hit the “South Chicago” you hear about on the news. When you hear about all that gun violence in “Chiraq” this is where it happens. My route took me to the lakefront path as quickly as possible. I didnt run into any problems on the south side but i did not dick around or stop at all. 

Outside of the southside Chicago is not terrible. I used to go down and ride around the city for hours a day so even before that trip i was beyond familiar with most of the city. You just need to be very careful. And whatever lock you have to lock up you bike, get something twice as thick. If its not a chain you may as well not use one. 

In any event, in both of these places, do not do anything to stand out. Dont stand there scratching your head while looking at a map. Plan your route, memorize it and execute it without dicking around in those areas. Just keep pedaling until you are to China Town or north of that. And then again, lock your bike and every part on it you hope to keep any time you are stepping away from your bike for more than 10 seconds and DO NOT lock it up outside overnight.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uh, I don’t know, maybe the other 7% that killed 25 people and caused $2 billion worth of damages? 

Also, let’s take that logic to its conclusion when applied to guns. 

“Only 7% of BLM protests were non peaceful, therefore they aren’t an excuse to be armed”. 

400,000,000 guns in America, 30,000 deaths per year. 

0.0075% of guns are used to kill per year, therefore waiting periods aren’t an excuse to prevent access to them. 

In fact, it seems that BLM protests are 933 times more likely to cause violence than the average gun. 

See how that logic falls apart?

549,"&gt;I love how you flip-flop between using revolutionist terms to idolizing colonialists.

Everyone I quoted was a Marxist so that's a strawman. But I do find it hilarious that you would accuse me of lionizing colonialism while defending a racist law given that gun control in America has a very racist motivation.

&gt;You're forced to learn a shit-ton of laws and pass tests before you're allowed to take the car unrestricted into traffic.

That's for driving on public roads. You don't have to do any that to actually buy the car or drive it around on private property. There's also no legal restriction on how old you need to be to buy a car. A 12 year old could save up babysitting money and buy an old beater with cash then drive it on private land without a license or insurance.

Compare this with buying a gun, where you have to be 18 (21 for handguns) just to have a chance at buying it. And if you have ever been arrested for smoking a joint, guess what, your background check will be rejected. That's assuming you don't live in a state where you have to wait an arbitrary number of days before your background check goes through.

&gt;Negligence will make it illegal for you to drive.

Wrong. Most of the time you wind up with a ticket, which doesn't take your license by default. Hell, even getting a DUI doesn't always result in losing your license. Discharging a weapon recklessly, on the other hand, tends not to be overlooked by the courts.

&gt;Not all cars pass inspection or are allowed into the market.

Very few cars aren't street legal in America, and it's mostly because they don't add certain mandated safety features. With guns, getting certain safety features like a suppressor requires another separate background check.

&gt;Yes! Let's make health, housing and food human rights, abolish wage slavery and give the real power to the people doing all the work rather than the rich. Just because I end up in a discussion about one thing doesn't mean I don't care about another.

Good, then you have your answer on how to reduce gun violence without trampling on peoples' civil rights.

550,"This is a *great* question.

The United States used to be generally worshipped and glorified for many, many, years. This was especially true for most of the 1990s and early 2000s. This was because America was a rich and developed country, with the best education, most advanced technology, and something for China to strive to be: rich and powerful. That is, many people in China saw the U.S as a role model and something to strive to become.

As China has become stronger, richer, and more advanced, a lot of that perspective has disappeared. While before, it was easy for a Chinese to immigrant to the U.S under the justification of higher standards of living, better healthcare, higher wages, and better education - at lot of those reasons have disappeared.

While before, it was easy for Chinese to look at America and claim it was objectively and subjectively better, it is much, much, harder to make that argument today. Today, the Chinese who glorify the U.S or think it is superior to the U.S are shrinking, and fast. The vast majority of graduates and undergraduates who study abroad return to China, and Chinese immigration to the U.S is decreasing. You do have some people who 'crave consumer goods and the freedom of the U.S' but those are the ones who immigrant. Hell, I've met quite a few Chinese who are returning to China after spending decades abroad because their opportunities in China are better than the U.S at this point in history.

Today, most Chinese view the U.S with confusion more than anything else. Most Chinese have no issue with America, most view it as a generic developed country, with lots of issues. Most Chinese don't view China - overall - any better or any worse than the U.S, rather they are just different. Sure, the U.S has lots of gun violence, but it also has some of the best universities. Sure, the U.S has horrible infrastructure, but it also has lots of amazing National Parks. Sure, Americans have freedom to vote, but they also have a completely dysfunctional political system. Sure Americans have access to Twitter and Facebook, but it also have a sizable portion of their population believing in insane conspiracy theories. In some ways it is better than China, in some ways it is worse. On balance, most Chinese prefer their economic, political, and social system to that of the United States. More importantly, it is not a function of brainwashing.

Hell, my son (5 Years Old) thinks China is 'strong' because of how much it is developing. I explained to my son that China is building so much because it is a developing country and is trying to become stronger. Now, every time my son sees construction he says 'China is strong!' Because, every Chinese recognizes, that despite what issues their social, political, and economic system has, it has worked! Their system has consistently improved the living standards of the average Chinese People. When they look at the U.S they don't see the same progress, they don't see their system of government working for the people.

What really, really, confuses and bothers the majority of Chinese is: Why does the U.S care so much about China? Why does the U.S not want a powerful and rich China? What exactly has China done to the U.S to make them want to sanction our companies and try to make use worse off? Why can America be rich and powerful, but we can't?

It's not that Chinese dislike or hate America, they're just generally confused as to why America seems to *not* want a rich, powerful, and strong China. A lot of them see the hypocrisy and double-standard and don't understand it.

It's the double-standard and hypocrisy that bothers a lot of Chinese more than anything else.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

553,"Yes I do but you can never really encapsulate complex economic theories in concise definitions. Socialism is an umbrella term for a more collectivized approach to society. Communism is a form in which private property (not personal property) and monetization of commodities would be abolished. Capitalism is a system in which private individuals with capital own the means of production. Market socialism is socialism in which a market system isn’t abolished but key industries such as healthcare would be nationalized and ownership would be collectivized with coops. Marxism is a way of analyzing and critiquing the current political economy through dialectal materialism. But you will not learn about socialism from me. I used to believe the same as you until I really started investigating what socialism means to people outside of America. 

And if communism will never work, then why did America try so hard to stop it? You realize that everything you know about socialism has been taught to you through American institutions? The same institutions that are controlled by capitalists. If anyone kills people they don’t agree with, it’s America. Look at Vietnam. Hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties and for what? Vietnamese communists literally just wanted their country back from the Western colonizers who had stripped Vietnam from its resources and after the Vietnamese defeated the French, the US decided that it was it’s duty to enter a foreign country and gun down poor rice farmers.

Socialism is trying to build a better society after capitalism. Building a new society in a world where it threatens the power of capitalists is going to require violence in order to build that society. Capitalists control the world, they control the narrative.

1- U.S. will fall: that's unlikely. U.S. can loose the preeminence as global empire, which is actually something I look forward, but the state collapse it's a totally different story. The centralized state holds the military, which can be deployed very fast. The Roman Empire felt because of local troops detached from the central government and lack of communications. What's going to happen there? Internet will stop working and the police will fight against bombing drones and nuclear weapons? The citizens will shoot with some civil grade gun against the marines? There's no match.


2- we will be on ourselves defending our way of life. Now, look, the European cultural and political and political tradition is very far from the American one. Even if the U.S. collapse we are just going to be less Americanized and more European. But the U.S. won't collapse. Maybe we could try, if the American empire collapse (different from U.S. state) to became senior partner of the alliance, or even better, to start a new and truly European geopolitical path. The actual one benefits only U.S.


3- china and Russia will run proxy states. That could actually be an option, but to be honest, America is running proxy states since a century now, with extreme bloodshed and violence, subverting government and installing capitalist dictators and puppet presidents ready to sell their countries to Americans' corporations. I'm not entirely sure that china and Russia will be able to do something worst. Africa seems to be pretty happy with Chinese neocolonialism. That's my opinion however, and may be controversial.



All in all, U.S. isn't about to collapse as a country, and we are going to greatly benefit from the collapse of the American global empire, not matter what happens, because we are actually junior partners in the block.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

568,"Article(1) here: 


&gt;HOURS BEFORE Jo Phoenix, a professor of criminology at the Open University, was due to give a talk at Essex University about placing transgender women in women’s prisons, students threatened to barricade the hall. They complained that Ms Phoenix was a “transphobe” likely to engage in “hate speech”. A flyer with an image of a gun and text reading “shut the fuck up, TERF” (trans-exclusionary radical feminist, a slur) was circulating. The university told Ms Phoenix it was postponing the event. Then the sociology department asked her for a copy of her talk. Days later it told her it had voted to rescind its invitation, and would issue no more. Ms Phoenix says she was “absolutely furious and deeply upset” about both the damage to her reputation and to academic freedom.
Essex University’s vice-chancellor asked Akua Reindorf, a lawyer who specialises in employment and discrimination law, to investigate. Eighteen months later, in mid-May, the university published Ms Reindorf’s report on its website. It said Essex had infringed Ms Phoenix’s right to freedom of expression and that its decision to “exclude and blacklist” her was also unlawful. It advised the university to apologise to Ms Phoenix and to Rosa Freedman, a professor of law at Reading University whom it had excluded from an event during Holocaust Memorial Week “because of her views on gender identity”. (Essex in the end allowed Ms Freedman to attend.)
Ms Reindorf’s report marks a challenge to the transgender dogma that originated on American campuses and has spread to universities around the English-speaking world. Its proponents hold that gender identity—the feeling that one is a man or a woman—is as important as biological sex and that trans people should in all circumstances be regarded as the gender with which they identify. This has increasingly influenced policy-makers: several places allow trans women into spaces that were once reserved for females, from sports teams to prisons and shelters for victims of domestic violence.
The opposing viewpoint, which is often described as “gender-critical”, might once have been considered mainstream. It argues that, since biological sex is unchangeable, even with hormones, surgery or any other form of treatment, the conviction that one has been born in the wrong body should not be dispositive. Gender critics argue that biological differences between the sexes make the continued provision of female-only spaces necessary. Trans activists say that trans women should have access to those places, too. “The emphasis that so-called gender-critical women place on what they describe as threats to women ignores the fact that trans women are overwhelmingly those who are threatened in single-sex spaces,” says Lisa Miracchi, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has signed open letters disapproving of gender-critical feminists.


&gt;The arguments the two sides put forward, in other words, are complex and debatable. But many trans activists think that any disagreement is tantamount to hate speech and try to suppress it. Some universities with policies that reflect the belief that trans women are women have acted on complaints about people who do nothing more than express a contrary view. In May, after students at Abertay University in Dundee reported that a student had said at a seminar that women have vaginas and men are stronger, the university launched an investigation.
In some cases, academics who have objected to “gender ideology”—the view that gender identity should trump biology—have been removed from professional posts. In April Callie Burt, an associate professor at Georgia State University, was fired from the editorial board of Feminist Criminology. She was told her presence might deter others from submitting manuscripts. The problem appears to have been her criticism of the conflation of sex and gender identity in proposed anti-discrimination legislation. Last June Kathleen Lowrey, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta, was removed as the chair of an undergraduate programme after students complained they felt unsafe. She says she reckons gender-critical posters on her office door were to blame.
&gt;Yet the most worrying effect is likely to be invisible. An unknown number of university employees avoid expressing their opinion for fear it will damage their career or turn them into pariahs. The report about Essex says witnesses described a “culture of fear” among those with gender-critical views. This is unlikely to be limited to one university. The report also argues that expressing the view that trans women are not women is not hate speech and is not illegal under British law, whatever university policies might suggest.

&gt;The fight back

&gt;The report is likely to embolden gender-critical academics in Britain, at least, where they are already more outspoken. There are signs that a backlash to gender ideology is building elsewhere, too. In February, when Donna Hughes, a professor of women’s studies at Rhode Island University, published an article critical of gender ideology, petitions sprouted calling for her to be fired. Her university denounced her and warned that the right to free speech was “not boundless”. Ms Hughes, who is a co-founder of the Academic Freedom Alliance (AFA), which was launched in March, says her university encouraged students to file complaints. She hired an “aggressive” lawyer. In May the AFA announced the university had dropped its investigations into Ms Hughes and affirmed her right to speak.
Ms Hughes’s example is striking because in America, where concerns about free speech in universities tend to focus on racial sensitivities, gender-critical views are rarely expressed publicly. This is partly because there is no federal legislation that specifically protects trans (or gay) people from discrimination, which lends a particular urgency to LGBT activism. Jami Taylor, a professor of political science at the University of Toledo and a trans woman, says she has experienced “transgender-related bias” throughout her career, from being called “it” by students and a colleague to being guided to the men’s bathroom.
&gt;America’s political polarisation makes it harder yet to debate such topics. Trans activists often portray gender criticism as a far-right cause. Though it is becoming that, too, it is a topic on which leftist feminists and social conservatives find agreement. In Britain most outspoken gender-critical academics are left-leaning, atheist feminists. Some in America are, too.
&gt;Their chief concern is the preservation of female-only spaces. In February Holly Lawford-Smith, a professor of philosophy at the University of Melbourne, launched a website (noconflicttheysaid.org) which invited women to describe their experiences of sharing female-only spaces with trans women. It is not a research project and its reports are unverified. Most describe a feeling of discomfort rather than any form of physical assault. Soon afterwards, around 100 of her colleagues signed an open letter claiming the website promoted “harmful ideology”. It called for “swift and decisive action by the university”. Ms Lawford-Smith kept her job, but there have been at least two marches at the university decrying that. “I think people quite enjoy having a nemesis on campus,” she says.
How did an ideology that brooks no dissent become so entrenched in institutions supposedly dedicated to fostering independent thinking? Pressure groups have played a big part. In Britain most universities and many public-sector bodies have joined the Stonewall Diversity Champions scheme, which means they have drawn up policies that reflect the group’s position on trans identity. The report about Essex said the university’s policy “states the law as Stonewall would prefer it to be, rather than the law as it is”, and could cause the university to break the law by indirectly discriminating against women. Itrecommended that Essex reconsider its relationship with Stonewall. Several bodies, including the government’s equality watchdog, have since left the Champions scheme.



&gt;The influence of pressure groups exemplifies the other big reason trans ideology has gained a foothold in academia: its elision with the rights of gay people. Many organisations established to defend gay rights have morphed into trans-rights groups. Tamsin Blaxter, a research fellow at Gonville &amp; Caius College, Cambridge and a trans woman, says that academia has become a lot more welcoming to trans people, thanks largely to Stonewall. But some gay people disagree with its new focus. In 2019 some supporters split from the group, in part owing to concerns that its stance encourages gay people to redefine themselves as trans (and straight), to form the LGB Alliance. Similar groups have sprung up around the world.
&gt;Students increasingly express gender-critical views. This year a group of feminist students in Cambridge ran a “replatforming” event for gender-critical scholars who had been excluded from academic events (Ms Phoenix was among the speakers). Sophie Watson, one of the organisers, says she has lost friends over the issue. “There’s so much fear over using the wrong language—to disagree with the line that trans women are women is really considered hateful,” she says.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
569,"I’m just going to leave this here for when “they” come.

The ACTUAL facts about gun violence in America:

There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:

• 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)

• 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 489 (2%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location:

298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)

327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)

328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)

764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)

That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.

This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)

You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)

Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14

Page 15:

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.

Older study, 1995:

https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;context=jclc

Page 164

The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.

r/dgu is a great sub to pay attention to, when you want to know whether or not someone is defensively using a gun

If you are arguing that they are wrong because they are hypocritical, then that's whataboutism. ""Oh you want to prevent gun deaths? What about other kinds of deaths?"" Your clarification of why it's not whataboutism is exactly whataboutism.

&gt;The way mass shootings are covered in this country is a problem. Why shouldnt they? Because just like suicides certain types of media coverage of those events leads to copy cats/clusters.

Moving the goalposts from ""shouldn't take precedence when determining policy"" to ""should be covered differently by the media."" Sure, I agree that media in general could be greatly improved in the US, in lots of areas including coverage of mass shooting.

&gt;. Also I literally laid put numerous policy objectives that i think should happen before we even discuss gun control because they would provide both immediate and long term improvements.

They are also all much less likely to pass, given that more people support gun reform than they do the things you listed. We can also do more than one thing at the same time.

&gt;Outside the pandemic you are blantently wrong about violent crime numbers, they continued to drop after 04.

I didn't say ""violent crime,"" I said ""gun violence,"" and specifically ""violence committed with assault weapons."" [Which is true](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28971349/). And you aren't allowed to just leave years out because you don't like what happened during them. Not if you are being honest, anyway. This is important, because you are arguing that the assault weapons ban being lifted somehow is related to reduced crime rates, but if you look at the one thing that would be mostly affected by a lifting of a ban on a certain type of weapon - crimes committed with that type of weapon - they went up along with access.

&gt; Violence in America is not a result of guns... It's a result of a broken system.  

Again, the root cause of people wanting to do violence is not guns, but guns let them do much more violence to many more people much more quickly than they could do otherwise. Which is the entire point of guns.

&gt; The gun control debate is moot as AWB are unconstitional

No they are not, any more than bans on full-auto weapons are.

&gt; and so called AW(a made up political term) are used in only a tiny fraction of violent crimes.

Who cares? We're not talking about assault weapons bans in particular, you just keep going back to them for some reason.

&gt; These other things are relevant because some of them are wildly more popular than gun control and would do more than gun control allegedly would to improve the country.

Gun regulation reform has 60% approval. Which of those other things are wildly more popular than it, but are not being proposed by Democrats?

&gt; At the end of the day it is your responsibility to maintain your physical safety and that of your family... Not even the police are obligated to protect you. Wishful thinking about a world without violence and evil people does nothing to fix the actual problems facing the world.

That's a lot of strawmen in a tiny box. I never said anything about any of that other stuff, or implied it. You can't keep yourself or your family safe from a random dude with a gun that wants to kill you. That's the fantasy - the one you have, where your gun protects you. It isn't going to. If the government wants you dead, you're dead. Before you get a chance to do shit about it. If a criminal wants to kill you, 9 times out of 10, you're dead. They aren't going to let you know they are coming and give you time to get your weapon ready. They'll just shoot you. The only time having a gun might help is if the criminal doesn't have one, or has one but doesn't really want to use it, and you see them coming. For the most part, other means of protection work just as well. And if the criminals had a harder time getting guns, there would be even less of a reason to have one. And on top of all that - _NOBODY IS SUGGESTING GETTING RID OF ALL GUNS_. We are saying you should need a license, registration, and training to own one. If you really think that having a gun in the house is more likely to protect you from scary criminals than it is to get someone in your family accidentally shot, then go for it. Take a class, get a license, and register it when you buy it.

&gt; Gun control is one of the stupidest to give priority to.

No it's not. Way too many people are dying of preventable deaths. It's one of many priorities we should be focusing on.

&gt; Most anti gun politicians have no fucking clue what they are talking about and the existing and propsed legislation proves that.

I'd take you seriously, but your proposal is ""fix all other problems first."" You might not like the solutions they are proposing, but unless you acknowledge the problem and start bringing _good_ ideas for regulation to the table, you are going to continue to get knee-jerk ""just take them away"" proposals. Because you are the one that feels a need to keep your guns, and everyone else is tired of watching kids get shot.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They will disallow for significant health conditions such as diabetes, history of cancer or heart attack. But generally it is not difficult if you use one of the express options. We came aboard through a pilot program for high needs industry (tech) and my husband had a job with a Canadian company already so it wasn't too difficult to get here. We live in Ontario. It's expensive, and he definitely makes less in salary, but no insurance company in the US would cover him so we had to pay for high risk insurance with 60/40 coverage at $36000 a year just for him. He also worked 50-70 hr weeks. Our overall tax rate for us in the states was 42%, here is is 38%.

My best friend in the states pays $350 after insurance for hers.

You are safer from guns in the fucking army than in an American school. In 2010 were 25 times as many gun homicides in the US as in the average of 22 other high income countries. There have been 2128 mass shootings in the US since 2013. In the U.K. in the same period there has been ONE with no fatalities. Gun violence in America is horrendous.

Basically on high alert to the point of going psycho. He lit up a pickup truck out of the side of a Humvee with a stolen AK because he was freaking out so much. 

I’m a gun supporter. I’ve owned probably 7 or 8 in my lifetime. Never wanted or have used it for violence. This specific scenario, and almost any scenario at a festival will not involve firearms. I get what your saying and agree, but context matters. If you snuck in a gun to this festival and shot someone, your fucked. Even if they were “breaking into your tent”.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
581,"But these gun crimes should not be happening because it is presumably illegal to purchase guns out of state and bring them back.  Passing yet another law to make it double illegal won’t stop violent criminals, especially ones who plan to kill themselves.   

There are hundreds of millions of firearms in America.   Even if a new law banned them overnight, these items still exist and criminals are still likely to not follow that law either.   Of course they cannot be banned, because nearly every person has the right to own and carry firearms, and firearms that are in common use are protected by the second amendment.   

People fail to realize that in the United States,  stricter gun laws do not generally lead to lower rates of gun violence.   

It seems counter intuitive, but plenty of states with lax gun laws have very low rates of gun crime, while plenty of states with strict gun laws have high rates of gun crime.

582,"&gt;I've met some serious assholes and morons who still managed to obtain concealed carry permits. 

And yet they're still six times safer to be around than cops.

&gt;but I strongly suspect more guns in more places will result in more negligent discharges, more incidents with armed hotheads escalating fistfights into shootings, and more gun violence in general.

Considering that there is a directly inverse proportional relationship between violence in an area and the number of Concealed Carry Permits in that area, I would be inclined to disagree with you. You're making an argument based on emotion, not any sort of actual data. When you concealed carry, it is your duty to step back from any fights. Every person who concealed carries knows the legal hassle of having to use your firearm, and would like to avoid it at all costs. Concealed carrying does not allow you to pull your firearm out in situations that are tense, it allows you to access your gun more easily in situations where it would otherwise be legal to use a gun. The rule in public is never draw your gun unless you intend to kill somebody. 

If you live in America, and not in New Jersey or Hawaii, chances are you come across people who are concealed carrying everyday and have no idea. Some people you are pretty close with probably concealed carry without your knowledge. I understand that it's a little bit confusing to get used to the idea, but concealed carry is actually very common, and the entire point is that you have no idea who is and isn't. Sure, you have some anecdotal evidence of some jerks who have licenses, but when's the last time they killed anyone in public, or had a negligent discharge?

&gt;While 3D printed guns are certainly going to be an issue, they aren't there yet, and there are some technical hurdles that I don't think will ever be simple enough to fix for home printers.

Yeah, it doesn't seem like you're familiar with the full extent of what's possible now. Obviously you can't print a barrel or a slide, but those aren't controlled parts, and anybody can order them, even if they're under 18, a felon, not a US citizen, or inanimate. Any modern polymer framed pistol or rifle can be printed with little to no issue. The fgc-9 can be made and machined completely at home with parts from your local hardware store, including barrel rifling which is extremely easy to do with ECM.  I can 3D print a Glock, and purchase the rest of the parts easily. Restricting every single Firearms part is completely unrealistic, so 3D printed guns are here to stay.

&gt;I don't understand why registration is seen as a bridge too far.

Imagine if you had to pay money to obtain a license to vote. A fundamental right is not a fundamental right if it's locked behind a paywall. If you're against poll taxes, you should be against registration. There's various other reasons why Universal registration is seen as a massive issue, including not wanting the government to know what guns you have, which is reasonable, not wanting to be revealed as a gun owner if there is a database breach, which considering the incompetence of our government is extremely likely, and also it not being anyone's business what I own.

Additionally, it's extremely unlikely that anyone acquiring a firearm for the purpose of committing a crime will bother to go through the registration process, so I really don't see how it will help prevent any crime. Guns will be made or imported illegally, used in crimes, and stay completely outside of the registration system. It might crack down on straw purchases, but those are extremely illegal as is.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
583,"The only issue there I have beef with is when legislators that clearly do not understand the basic functioning of a gun try to pass laws which often end up being purely cosmetic because they don’t know anything. As a Marylander, I’ve lived under that silliness long enough. Watch a ten minute YouTube video and THEN write the bill. Otherwise it’s just inconveniencing some to placate others. 

I don’t need you to know anything about firearms for us to have a conversation. I don’t care whether or not you choose to keep a firearm in the house for protection. I always suggest people make use of floor door stops, alarms, a dog, motion lights and cameras before buying a gun for home defense. 

Personal liberty isn’t tied to the AR but the efforts to ban the AR, the statements made in favor of this are illogical unless your primary concern isn’t gun violence but public mass shootings which make up a small percentage of gun deaths. Why isn’t anyone talking about banning handguns? When that is finally explained to me, I’ll be open to changing my view and my rifle to a bullpup. 

I am self sufficient af but I blame that on Boy Scouts and a wonderful father. I couldn’t care less how you choose to move through the world as long as you’re not hurting others.

584,"&gt;I didnt say other countries don't have mass killings.  Just that they don't happen at the same frequency they do in the states.  Also America has non gun related mass killings so I don't see how that is relevant.

Yes, because America has more crime in general. This is also reflected by how other countries also had less crime before they banned guns, and didn't see any notable drop in overall crime afterwards. Gun crime may have gone down, but other forms, like knife crimes, went up.

&gt;I am not terribly familiar with California gun law but I see nothing that makes it more restrictive then Canada. Most of them look like Canadian laws except we do not allow any public carrying of firearms at all, concealed or open.

Neither does California for the most part. However, there are guns that are legal in Canada that aren't in the US. For example, you guys have easy access to the Type 97, we don't. Short barrel shotguns in certain forms are also allowed. 

Also, unrestricted guns can be carried unloaded.

&gt;I don't know what the answer is . I do not live there and am not pro gun. I am not anti gun either I just see guns as a tool to protect my farm from coyotes and maybe for shooting gophers. A varmint rifle is a I need. What I do know is gun violence in the US is getting worse not better and leaving things as is won't help. Arguing the semantics of what an ""assault rifle "" is or is not is happening up here too. But its just that, semantics. No average person needs an AR15 with an extended clip and a bump stock. For sport or hunting you don't need an automatic or even semi automatic weapon.

What separates an AR-15 from any other weapon? That's the thing. Also, damn near every gun in the past 100 years is semi-automatic, which the AR-15 also is. That's why ""semantics"" is important. Everybody knows what an AR-15 is, but nobody knows what actually separates an AR-15 from any other weapon, and that's because there really isn't anything. Therefore, every gun law either ends up being very broad, which affects a lot of innocent people, or too narrow, which means it does nothing. And criminals won't bother going through the laws anyways.

&gt;As to ""The fact is, the only people who would follow any law are people who weren’t gonna shoot people anyways."" Pretty sure the last mass shooting we had here the guns were bought legally as are a lot of the ones used in your mass shootings. So I am pretty sure this arguement wont hold up. A quick check says 86 % of mass shootings were committed with a legally obtained firearm.

Most gun crime isn't, and that's because mass shootings account for a very small portion of actual deaths. You're more likely to die from bare hands and feet, or a blunt instrument, than you are from any rifle in the US. Not to mention even then, the only reason the mass shooter uses a particular gun right now is because it's available. Remove that, and they'll just go with the next one. And if guns are completely illegal, then they'll just obtain one off the black market with just a little more difficulty, and nothing will change.

Either that, or they'll use gasoline, knives, or a motor vehicle, none of which will ever be banned. Yeah, they're ""not designed to kill"", but that's irrelevant. They'll always be able to kill, but since they're not ""designed"" to, they'll never have any political will to ban them, so people will always die. It's also why we see gun suicides accounting for 2/3 of all gun deaths, yet places like Japan and South Korea have higher suicide rates.

Safe storage prevents that. Accidents are lessened by training. Strengthening background checks decreases that ability for someone to get a gun from a retail source unlawfully.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30711465/

&gt;&gt; Despite the public, political, and media narrative that mental health is at the root of gun violence, evidence is lacking to infer a causal link. This study examines the temporal associations between gun violence (i.e., threatening someone with a gun and gun carrying) and mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, stress, PTSD, hostility, impulsivity, and borderline personality disorder) as well the cross-sectional associations with gun access and gun ownership in a group of emerging adults... Counter to public beliefs, the majority of mental health symptoms examined were not related to gun violence. Instead, **access to firearms was the primary culprit.**

What do you think mental health professionals can do about gun violence? Are they cops? Can they force people to submit to analysis and treatment? If a mental health professional has a patient that presents as violent to others, can they violate patient privacy laws and gun owner protections? The reality is mental health care providers aren't cops, they can't force people to accept treatment and they can't disclose private patient information. For gun culture to scapegoat mental illness then place the burden on health care providers to solve the problem is immoral.

In America the root cause of gun violence is access to guns, legally because laws are lax and illegally because guns are so overproduced and are so common.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; How many deaths will it take? Give me your threshold of when gun violence will become a statistical problem at least.

That is a non sequitur.  You cannot remove all guns in America.  It cannot happen without a constitutional amendment and until the number of people who don't want guns banned drops to about 25% of the population it won't happen.

593,"&gt; Many families are desperate because they can’t get help for loved ones with severe mental illness who don’t consent to treatment, said Evelyn Burton, advocacy chair for the Maryland chapter of the Schizophrenia and Related Disorders Alliance of America.
&gt; 
&gt; “It leaves them helpless,” Burton said.
&gt; 
&gt; Psychiatric laws vary widely across the country.
&gt; 
&gt; “We like to say that we’re running 50 different experiments with mental health care in this country,” said Geoffrey Melada, spokesman for the Treatment Advocacy Center.
&gt; 
&gt; In a 2020 report, the center ranked Maryland the worst in the nation for its psychiatric laws, citing factors including the standard for involuntary admission and the lack of what is known as “assisted outpatient treatment” for severe mental illness, in which the court orders someone to undergo treatment in a community setting. Maryland is one of only three states that does not have that.
&gt; 
&gt; A Baltimore pilot program for assisted outpatient treatment started in 2018. It does not impose penalties on those who fail to adhere to the court-ordered treatment plan.
&gt; 
&gt; Efforts are underway in both the county and in Baltimore to connect more people with services by diverting some 911 calls to mental health professionals rather than police. Democratic County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. recently announced an expansion of the county’s mobile crisis teams, which include mental health professionals and specially trained police officers.
&gt; 
&gt; Maryland law allows family, friends, neighbors and others to petition for an emergency psychiatric evaluation for someone. One neighbor whose family filed for a peace order against Brown said they did not know there was another option.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, the state’s extreme risk protective order law, often referred to as a “red flag” law, lets police, family members, housemates, intimate partners and medical professionals petition a court for an order to temporarily seize someone’s guns and prevent them from buying firearms.
&gt; 
&gt; Raising awareness of these existing tools is crucial, said Dr. Arkaprava Deb, a psychiatrist in Baltimore.
&gt; 
&gt; “We want the community to know about these interventions,” said Deb, who also works on gun violence prevention issues with the advocacy group Doctors for America.
&gt; 
&gt; Deb said that he has seen people with severe mental illness who, with treatment, go on to graduate school, marriage, homebuying and otherwise “thriving” in life.
&gt; 
&gt; “Recovery is a lot more attainable than the public believes,” Deb said.
&gt; 
&gt; Deb said mental health providers and public health professionals hope to learn more from the investigation of the Woodlawn case. His key questions include whether Brown had a diagnosed mental illness and, if he did, whether he had any clinical interventions in the past year.
&gt; 
&gt; The case deserves a hard look, mental health advocates say.

2. The Nazis also campaigned that immigrants were bringing crime and disease into Germany. Real Germans needed a means to defend themselves from these undesirables, leading to...
3. The Weimar Republic had strict gun control laws; Nazis campaigned on the promise that they would return guns to the German people so that they could defend themselves from the aforementioned immigrant scourge.
4. The Weimar Republic had a relatively robust social safety net; the Nazis campaigned on the premise that this allowed parasitic freeloaders to take advantage of hardworking ""real Germans."" They called for an end to social programs and nationalized healthcare.
5. The lugenpresse, or ""lying press."" The Nazis stated that the news was unfairly biased against them and couldn't be trusted, and in multiple cases stirred up violence against reporters. Once in power Hitler had millions of small, cheaply made radios distributed to the general population; these radios received only one channel, the official Nazi Party propaganda channel. Hitler stated that this would allow him to bypass lying journalists to speak directly to the German people. At least he wasn't limited to 280 letters per message.
6. ""Make Germany Great Again"" was literally an often used slogan from Hitler, an appeal to a largely imaginary golden age of the past where Germany was filled only with pure white Aryans and thus was prosperous. That one shouldn't need any further explanation.

Trust me, I don't like making the comparison. I wish it weren't the case. But here in America we've raised ""not learning from history"" to a goddamned art form, and that leads to us walking down familiar roads blissfully oblivious to where they end up.

American foreign policy supports israel because it is a benefit to us interests. Israels enemies are secular arab nationalists (Syria, Iraq, Formerly Egypt,) and Iran.

600,"Here's another that's full of statistics...
?

Here are some quick statistics on gun violence in America:

In 2018, there were roughly 40,000 gun related deaths, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.0122% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

We can go further and breakdown those 40,000 deaths:

• 24,000 (60%) are by suicide (3)

• 1,000 (2.5%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 500 (1.25%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 40,000 annually, but rather roughly 13,500... 0.004% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location. According to a review of FBI homicide statistics (6), the 10 cities with the highest firearm homicide rates (Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, Louisville, Milwaukee, St.Louis, Baltimore, Birmingham, Memphis, and New Orleans) make up roughly 20% of those deaths.

This leaves 10,800 deaths for everywhere else in America... about 200 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 10,000 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)

You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)

Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 62% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14

Page 15:

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.

Older study, 1995:

https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;context=jclc

Page 164

The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.

r/dgu is a great sub to pay attention to, when you want to know whether or not someone is defensively using a gun. It is a common myth that ""Gun owners are only saved 1% of the time using a gun"". That cherry picked claim is based on this study. The problem with this study is that it's really hard to decipher when someone was saved + how often that is not reported to the police if no loss of life/injury occurred. The data also lumps gun owners and non-gun owners together to achieve that incorrect 1%.

?

——What can we do?——

Many users have asked in the comments, ""Those are great stats, but what do we actually do?""

This is an entirely valid question and should indeed be the end goal of this longstanding debate.

I think a good place to start would be mental health in America; which in turn would address the suicides. Suicides make up 2/3's of all firearm related deaths. It's indeed shocking.

According to the Associated Press, which obtained data from the National Alliance on Mental Illness:

?

    43.6 million adults in the U.S. had mental illness in the past year
    17 million children in the U.S. experience mental health problems.
    10 million adults suffered from serious mental illness last year.

In 2019, American men died by suicide 3.63x more often than women.

?

Things we can do:

-Increased avenues of access toward mental health. This is through employers, schools, healthcare providers. These avenues of access could be in hospitals, clinics, employee offices, colleges, high schools, middle &amp; elementary schools, community organizations, online, etc. They need to all have training in the most common of conditions, such as depression, suicidal ideation, alcohol dependency, anxiety and drug use. Schools &amp; universities should especially have focus in detect learning disabilities, eating disorders and early stages of psychotic and mood disorders and engage students in care.

-An end to ""red flagging"" people who have depression from owning a firearm. I don't think someone having a rough time should be barred from owning a firearm. They still deserve a chance at self defense. I have read several replies about people saying, ""Sometimes I wonder if I have depression. But I'm scared of getting help and having my firearm being taken away because I live in a bad neighborhood"".

-Modernization of mental health programs &amp; telemedicine. This partially goes in line with increasing avenues. But there are many areas of mental healthcare that need to be modernized. One improvement that we've seen is the advent of telemedicine via phone (suicide hotlines), webcam/tablet/PC access, etc. Also, computerized clinical decision support for treating patients who are not responding to initial medication trials, telemedicine, and computer-guided adaptations of psychosocial treatments for people with serious mental illnesses are innovations that need to be looked into further.

-Increased access to firearms safety courses for all. Especially online. There are many paid classes you can get up and take right now. But due to COVID-19 or other social constrains, many people would benefit from online firearms safety courses. I don't think mandatory classes need to be in effect as some people need a firearm ASAP to defend themselves from an angry ex or people who wish to do them harm. They do *not* have the luxury of time. Waiting 4 weeks for a mandatory safety class would be more detrimental to them. But more safety can be encouraged in other ways.

——Is this a copypasta?——

The original format of this post was not copied from ""clippinwings451"".

The original format of this comment was actually from a gun debate in early 2017 on one of Steven Crowder's Facebook page posts by a commenter. Unfortunately, this post has long been deleted and I cannot cite the original person's name for creating this format. This was the original source for these numbers, a study done by the Institute of Medicine &amp; National Research Council.

As you can see, the original posting's numbers have indeed increased since it's posting; which I have corrected. For instance, the total firearms deaths have increased from 30,000 (per the original post) to 40,000, according to the latest 2018 statistics. I have also included a variety of solutions in my posting and made other changes.

601,Why do Americans instinctively reach for a gun to solve every problem? This laissez faire attitude towards guns and gun violence is undoubtedly one of the reasons why America is the most violent country in the western world.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
602,"Well, probably because people over the age of 65 exist, gunshots don't spread virally, and nearly 600k Americans have not died of gunshots in about a year's time, with 3.5 million dead worldwide.

Don't get me wrong, gun violence in America is a HUGE issue, but your comparison is silly.  Covid was obviously the bigger health crisis to deal with over the last year and though it is slowing down now, it won't go away if everyone just gives up.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
603,"I think you massively underestimate the lucrative nature of the criminal underground. There’s no good guy en mass. Period. The only way to stop gun violence is to stop producing guns. That isn’t going to happen. But, the answer is not more gun legislation. People will still find ways to kill other people, and more legislation will only make it harder for the average American to protect their home from a criminal underground fraught with guns, regardless of how hard it would supposedly be to get them. Think prohibition America. 

The worst thing to bring to a gun fight is a knife, and more legislation against guns is only ensuring that you and I will at best have only a knife to protect ourselves from those that would do us or our family harm. Eliminate gun free zones. Allow anyone with a base level of training to carry a gun. Mutually assured destruction is the only thing that’s ever been proven to have worked in an arms race. And make no mistake that’s exactly what it is. An arms race. If every criminal knew there was a significant chance their victim could be armed, they would think twice before engaging. It wouldn’t stop, nothing would stop a determined criminal.. but would at least give pause.

Unfortunately there is not a lot of data as far as how much gun violence comes from registered vs. unregistered guns. There is no doubt in my mind that stricter gun control will lead to a decrease in gun violence. But will people consider that enough? There will still be gun violence and victims will obviously not feel better if they know a loved one died from someone who was properly registered and checked. Will this just lead to more and more control while the roots of the systemic problems in America are left untouched?

*In one experiment, CA would show people on online panels pictures of simple bar graphs about uncontroversial things (e.g., the usage rates of mobile phones or sales of a car type) and the majority would be able to read the graph correctly. However, unbeknownst to the respondents, the data behind these graphs had actually been derived from politically controversial topics, such as income inequality, climate change, or deaths from gun violence. When the labels of the same graphs were later switched to their actual controversial topic, respondents who were made angry by identity threats were more likely to misread the relabeled graphs that they had previously understood. What CA observed was that when respondents were angry, their need for complete and rational explanations was also significantly reduced. In particular, anger put people in a frame of mind in which they were more indiscriminately punitive, particularly to out-groups. They would also underestimate the risk of negative outcomes. This led CA to discover that even if a hypothetical trade war with China or Mexico meant the loss of American jobs and profits, people primed with anger would tolerate that domestic economic damage if it meant they could use a trade war to punish immigrant groups and urban liberals.*

607,"**Please introduce yourself. Who are you, why are you qualified, and what do you hope to achieve this term in Congress?** 

My name is model-elleeit and I’m running to become your Representative in Washington. You may know me as one of your assemblymen in the state government; however, I felt called to run to represent you nationally. This is because the Democrat candidate for this seat, Lieutenant Governor Dewey, has a track record of dishonesty, inconsistency, and deceit. He doesn’t believe in governmental openness or even legislative deliberation. I’m running to offer another choice — integrity, stability, transparency. We need to ensure that our government is properly held accountable for its actions, and that it must reckon with the people whom it affects.

One of my core beliefs is that the government must be transparent with its constituents. Over the past few decades, this principle of government has been eroded by [power hungry officials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a-wvhqyKbNZoe07Mrwn9_3LlfXoT5IASbe94Yy-Y1M0/edit) who [fail to properly serve their constituents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zn9k8w3L7PqW-SKQ0SAyZ8zcoOTcpGpLCmdFdbknko0/edit). America is supposed to be a republic by and for the people, yet we have elected representatives who would rather do anything other than represent their constituents to make a quick dollar. If elected, I will break the streak of untrustworthy politicians and work to restore faith in this government, returning back to the principles upon which this country is built.

My opponent, whom I have opposed in both the State Capitol and State Supreme Court, believes the opposite. He has shown a lack of care when it comes to the government being responsible before as Lieutenant. Governor. An excellent example is his first DOJ Directive, that would, in my opinion, violate the state constitution by failing to enforce laws. This kind of carelessness and lack of respect for the constitution is something that we as Americans should be concerned about. Furthermore, my opponent [does not believe that bills should receive proper scrutiny](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dxl6tnUNTv5mKnsZ75D1Y4dm7loerBQtXKB0Sqb1eqI/edit) and debate. I strongly disagree with this absurd notion. I think that that would be a dangerous idea for legislatures to adopt. The very purpose of legislatures is to consider legislation from all angles, to deliberate, and to think. This last, the concept of thinking about legislation before voting on it, is evidently a weak point for Mr. Dewey. Regardless, I promise the opposite; we must uphold the founding principles of our nation.

If elected, I will be a voice of reason and advocate for governmental transparency in Washington. My opponent cannot say the same, because he has shown time and again that he does not care whether the government is responsible or open, so long as it’s as far left as he is.

**The Governors of Fremont and Superior recently signed a compact intended to establish reciprocity in concealed-carry permits between the states. Do you believe this is a step in the right direction? Conversely, how should we address gun violence?**

I do believe that reciprocity in concealed-carry permits is a step in the right direction. Making it simpler for gun owners to carry their guns across state lines is a simple, non-controversial, step to take. On the broader issue of gun violence, I think that we need to approach the issue from a reasonable standpoint, one that won’t curtail the rights of people, but instead curtail gun violence. I believe an easy way to do this is to implement things such as [universal background checks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6816623/) and [red flag laws](https://news.uindy.edu/2018/06/01/research-finds-link-between-reduction-in-firearm-suicides-and-red-flag-gun-laws/). If both of these were implemented, we would see a noticeable decrease in things such as homicide rates and gun related suicides. Pragmatic solutions like these are what’s needed to end the growing gun violence problem, yet still protect law abiding gun owners who are not a part of the problem. 

**A free college education bill recently failed on a knife-edge in the legislature. If elected, what measures would you take to ensure affordable education?**

As you may know, I was one of the assemblymen to vote against the free college education bill. While I agree that we should make college more accessible and affordable, I think that the money spent providing free college to everyone could be better spent. We need to invest in our public schools and introduce classes that would benefit people who don’t wish to go to college. We are in need of jobs that require hard work but not a college degree — skilled workers like electricians and plumbers. If we don’t invest properly we’re not going to regain our place in the world as a [manufacturing heavyweight](https://cepr.net/the-decline-of-blue-collar-jobs-in-graphs/). I also believe that less fortunate Superians should receive aid when it comes to college, but that people who can afford college on their own should have to pay for themselves. In places like Detroit and Flint, we need to invest in our tradespeople if we wish to start rebuilding the rust belt. Manufacturing jobs have been disappearing from people right under their feet, and no one has acted on this issue. I am committed to building back our manufacturing industry, and investing in blue collar jobs is one surefire way to do that.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
608,"Hello, Appalachia!

### Please introduce yourself. Who are you, why are you qualified, and what do you hope to achieve this term in Congress?

I am Representative Aikex, the current representive for loveliest and most beautiful parts of our nation, as well as areas such as Ohio. Further, I am the House Majority Whip, responsible for ensuring that the people of the House can get things done.

Let me be clear: During my time in this office, first appointed and then elected to represent this great region, my heart has always been with the people who elected me, and even those who don't.

The goal, as it's always been with ol' Altoids as your representative in the House, has been to take power back from both Wall Street and unnecessary government and putting it back into the hands of working-class people. Each ballot with my name checked off is a covenant between me and that person, to act in **their** individual interests, understand what will help **them** and act on it. And I do, I try everyday to ensure that every American has the ability to make their own decisions and live their own lives in a way that does not depend on others, improving their independence and ability to live out the freedom that every American deserves.

Here's what that means: more bang for every buck you spend in federal taxes, and a promise to work towards what **you** need as only a public servant can. That philosophy is exactly the sort of qualification that ought to be needed to serve a constituency like CH-2, and truly represent our slice of America in the House.

### Congress has overridden the President's veto to reinstate the FCC's controversial Fairness Doctrine. Do you support this measure? More generally, do you view political polarization and disinformation as problems that Congress should be involved in solving?

Since day one, I have been an ardent supporter of my good friend, Senator Polkadot's bill.

I want to make it real clear to the American people: this bill is a true litmus test for what can truly be done in the divided government we currently face, and a disgusting display of what the GOP is capable of doing when they feel the public isn't looking.

President Ninjja's veto of this bill was an outrage, one that I feel it will stain his administration until its end. He has shown us that the Republican party is not quite over the Trumpite past that looms behind it now like a spectre, a spectre which still seems to be capable of possessing the current administration.

The reality is that President Ninjja understands quite well the fact that part of what his party is built on nowadays is misinformation and biased reporting, to construct a myriad of false truths that together form a cartoonish and insane understanding of the world, because ultimately modern conservatism cannot exist anymore except in a realm of fantasy.

When the government rejects the idea of having you see ideas that are at odds with it, that make the government look weak or illogical, that is the beginning of tyranny.

This all shows more than ever *why* measures like S.3 are so important. The GOP is not going to shake off the white supremacist lunacy that has been its strongest faction for half a decade until we all force them to.

And this is not a leftist agenda, or the SJW agenda or whatever. I want to emphasize that this legislation was written and sponsored by Senator Polkadot, who is a key and respected moderate within our party and within the Senate. The only people who do not want this are the far-right elements in the party who'd see their very reality collapse the moment a few broadcasters are required to give an alternative take about anything, which I am disappointed to see is still in the majority within the Republican party.

Our country needs healing, and that healing involves doing things that ensure that anything like 1/6 will never happen again, and part of that means making information of all colours more widely available, to keep the American voting base strong, educated, and capable of making the sort of good decisions that lead us away from what we've been moving towards for a while now.

### This term saw the defeat of a high profile gun control measure pushed by the Speaker in the legislature. Where do you stand on the debate between firearms safety and the Second Amendment, and what is the balance to be struck?

I am very good friends with the author of this bill, Speaker Jaccobei. While not written as an author or sponsor, he and I were in collaboration to help ensure that this bill had the best chance possible at success.

I will make it clear: I agree with the views and positions of this bill. I think it is necessary to do something that ensures that firearms are not granted to those who are known to be mentally ill or otherwise provably incapable of using such a device responsibly. A lot of shooters are people who were provably mentally ill prior to getting access to a firearm.

That being said, I think it is important to realize that a majority of shootings are also motivated by racism, and that in general mental illness is not just something that exists in individuals, it is a societal problem.

The pandemic has brought forward a wave of deaths of despair and depression among many people, and obviously the solution to that has never been to remove all citizens' rights to owning a firearm. The goal, the ultimate goal, is to make it so that the sort of severe and antisocial mental illness that affects many shooters does not become so prevalent. No restrictive gun law in the world is going to erase antisocial mental illness from existing, and it is privileged and negligent to pretend that such a thing would be a satisfactory response in its own right.

The integration of mental illness services into B.65 were a key part of why I supported it; gun violence is a problem that requires a two-pronged attack against it, and that bill was a very good step in that direction. Unfortunately, B.65's section 6(a)(i) made it possibly unconstitutional, and that is why my friends in the state assembly ended up voting against it. I hope that in the future I and other state leaders can bring to the Assembly an alternative bill that will carry out the provisions of B.65 in spirit and bring Appalachia closer to a sensible and whole solution to the problem of gun violence which has become a weekly matter of conflict in this country.

When comparing our papers to others who had more moderate or liberal opinions, you could see in the red marks and comments on the pages that we got docked more for our views than our writing ability. I guess either fortunately or unfortunately she did this for any opinion piece we had to write, not just the one about firearms. Her class was one of my least favorite through all four years and probably one of the biggest wastes of time I have ever had. The more recent and bothering instance is the company I work for. They are based out of Australia, and following the New Zealand mosque shooting they took a very harsh stand on anything firearms related. We cannot deal with any company that is related to firearms, ammunition, accessories, etc. unless they solely supply governments. This also means that if we associate ourselves with the company on any social media, we cannot post anything that goes against company policies. I'm not very active on social media to begin with, but it made me extremely wary of putting either the company or anything firearms related on social media for fear of it causing issues at work. I refrain from mentioning my hobby to anyone at work for the same reason. I really like my job, and I would prefer to avoid causing anything unfortunate to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on to stereotypes. The first one I can think of is that gun owners are somehow uneducated or unintelligent. Some of the smartest individuals I have ever met or listened to have been prevalent firearms owners. I've met countless engineers and doctors at the range, or when shooting sporting clays. Which is probably partially due to them having the disposable income to shoot more often than those with lower paying jobs. Additionally, if you watch some of the precision shooting competitors on YouTube it becomes almost immediately apparent how intelligent many of them are. They're able to understand, measure, explain, and control complex things such as barrel harmonics, metallurgy, machining &amp; engineering principles, and the list goes on. The second stereotype was one I did a paper on in University for one of the better professors I had during my time there. He was the exact opposite of the one mentioned above, but he too was more liberal in his political views (he just didn't let his views affect his grading). It was the idea that guns can only be a manly thing, or that women should only be attracted to dainty/pink firearms. I've seen this from both inside and outside the gun community. Women should feel comfortable approaching any type of firearm or firearm competition they want to without fear of being oogled at or laughed at. I had a guy who worked at an indoor range look at me weird when I wanted to have my girlfriend try a FN Five Seven instead of some pink subcompact he had mentioned was nice for ladies. She is 6' 2"" and has larger hands. There is no way in hell that subcompact would have been comfortable for her to shoot as her first handgun. But she loved the Five Seven and would eventually like to get one. I should note here that it wasn't being looked at as a carry pistol. She just wanted to target shoot. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Media. This is 100% dependent on the type of media one consumes, as are most issues that have any amount of controversy surrounding them. On the far left side you have the media that makes it seem like guns are the only thing causing violence and death within America, despite them contributing very little to deaths in the US (especially if you remove suicides). On the far right you have media that makes it seem like firearms are the answer to everything and should have zero restrictions. I definitely agree with more of the right side of the spectrum's depictions of firearms in the media, but I know that some outlets take it a bit too far. Overall though I would say that the media as a whole has quite a bit more of a negative disposition towards firearms and their owners than a positive one. As for the marches, I agree with the sentiment of ending school shootings, as does every sane person out there. However, I disagree with the idea that almost any of the proposed measures and legislatures those marches seemingly support would actually stop tragedies like the shootings to occur. I also think they are misdiagnosing the problem as firearms, when the bigger issue is surrounding mental health or extremist ideologies of any sorts. It's an extremely complex issue and not one that I have the whole answer to, but I do know that punishing and preventing innocent people from defending themselves is not the correct answer.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
611,"I live in South America and I’ve never seen gun violence in person either. I live in the capital of my country  eh  which is considered “unsafe” according to Americans. I’ve never been robbed. I’ve never felt unsafe. Do I take precautions? Yeah, like you would in any large city. But the same applies to South America. Maybe avoid certain areas but there’s plenty of great places to visit and despite popular belief there’s a lot of great people here. Don’t write us off because of some isolated cases that go viral on the internet.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
612,"My point is that background checks for handguns should have a (much) larger aggregate impact on firearm assaults than background checks on rifles. Handguns are also much more likely to be used, as you said, against a domestic partner and in tragedies involving children. 

That's assuming background checks are effective at reducing assault instances at all. When about 8k handguns are used in gun crime every year, it seems likely they slip through the cracks. 

Mass shootings 'only' total about 1000 deaths and 1500 injuries since 1982, which, as sad as it sounds, compares with about two weeks of baseline gun violence in America.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
613,"I want to protect my family, too. That's why I have a dog. He's thwarted one burglar so far, and I don't have to worry about my kids killing each other with him.

I don't care whether the gun is used primarily for defense or offense, the result is the same: dead bodies. There are so many non-lethal ways to defend yourself, your loved ones, and your possessions.

Your statement about America not being the only country with a violence problem makes the case for me. They don't have the firearm violence numbers *because they don't have guns*. No more guns, no more gun violence. And no, guns won't go away overnight, but maybe my kids won't have to wonder if today is the day a mass shooting happens in their town every time they drop off my grandkids at school.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
614,"&gt; I'm not at all a fan of Foucault's intellectual project, but people on the right think of him as the founding father of ""White Fragility""-type idpol which just isn't the case

No, certainly not directly, in the sense that ""white fragility"" was something he came up with. That much isn't true. He isn't entirely disconnected, however. From the book previously mentioned:

&gt; Neoliberalism as a thought collective and path dependency has largely succeeded in the economic ‘neutralization’ of the political left in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. The search for a left governmentality, or the making of the welfare state a ‘vast experimental field’ by centre-left parties, together with a widespread intellectual anti-statism and rejection of formal politics in favour of local social movements and the vitality of civil society, has undermined labour and social democratic parties’ organic concerns with the conditions of the working and precarious populations, leaving little effective voice of discontent other than anti-globalist appeals to a ‘walled sovereignty’. Instead, as exemplified by the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016, the centre-left has become – or at least can be readily portrayed by its opponents as – the party of diversity and ‘politically correct’ identity politics disconnected from fundamental concerns around economic exploitation, widening inequality, narrowing life chances and falling life expectancy for a sizable segment of its traditional constituency. Even #MeToo, a movement which began as an important collective fight against sexual harassment and sexual exploitation, has been appropriated by a neoliberal individualist agenda focused on the number of women gaining entry to Harvard or becoming CEOs of major corporations, or on the relative size of Hollywood stars’ pay cheques. As a consequence of this, it becomes possible to articulate economic grievance and disappointment by attacking the cultural as well as economic ‘elites’ of contemporary capitalism. It also becomes possible to articulate a kind of inverse identity politics for those left out of it. Thus, groups that include many who would be conventionally defined through ascribed characteristics as white, male and working-class demand to be heard not in terms of their class position but as yet another identity group with their own activities, needs and rights. Is not gun ownership simply another lifestyle choice for people in rural areas? In an age where sexual minorities discover the truth about themselves and assert their rights through the overcoming of ordeals, should the same not apply to the ordeals of involuntarily celibate men, as the ‘incel’ movement argues? As Walter Benn Michaels has recently noted, this dynamic is now leading an increasing number of white people to represent their own problems in terms of discrimination. In a society where the gap between the wealthiest 10 per cent and the rest is widening, a growing number of them, feeling themselves losing ground, think they are not victims of exploitation but of positive discrimination. As Benn Michaels notes, ‘while Trumpists tell them they’re the victims of racism’, ‘liberals tell them they’re racists’. The very way in which social injustice is understood has been profoundly affected as a result. The abandonment by the Left of traditional concerns with exploitation has opened the way for populism and a new identity politics on the Right, duly turned into a therapeutics with its own ‘technologies of the self’ offered by celebrity intellectuals – such as the Canadian psychologist, Jordan B. Peterson – who, in another time, might simply have been regarded as flaky or nutcases.

&gt; A parallel development has occurred in ‘progressive’ politics in general. It too has turned from the formal political domain of parties focused on state power to the question of subjectivity, as Foucault had forecast. If for Foucault, and Deleuze and Guattari, the main enemy of transversal politics was the fascism within each of us and the micro-fascisms in our daily lives and experiences, and particularly in the bearers of formal authority of all types, today progressive politics, particularly in the United States, exhorts (and indeed trains through corporate ‘diversity management’ programmes) whites to confront their inner racism, and, in doing so, overcome what Robin DiAngelo has called their ‘white fragility’. Alongside the protests that erupted in the United States in 2020 against police killings of Black people, we find a renewed confessional politics that is closer to the self-mortification practices of exomologesis identified by Foucault than to the private confessionals of the experts of the welfare state he traced to the institutionalized Catholic Church. As the warring sects of the seventeenth-century confessional conflicts in Europe illustrated, one of the problems with confronting the enemy within – in a process of ‘lifelong self-transformation’ that will allow entry into the charismatic community of believers – is that it is all too easy to identify those still possessed by such an inner enemy as your own deadly enemy. The ‘civil religion of America’, as Robert Bellah called it in the 1960s – which allowed a degree of civility between conflicting groups with different interests and viewpoints and encompassed those without strong beliefs – can all too readily give way to a kind of sectarian violence between those passionately committed to diametrically opposed value systems. For us, the main lesson concerning the practice of confession lies not in the ‘subjectification’ machinery of the bureaucratic welfare state and the human sciences, as it did for Foucault, but in the new collective self-confrontations and experimentations, expiations of guilt and ordeals, that occur in public spaces and practices: in the workplace, on the streets, and in the stadium.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
615,"&gt;The problem is that those programs which address access to education, paths to college and prosperity, things which address the wealth gap between whites and POC ... they are crazy expensive, high time, high investment, decades long projects. Doesn't play well at the polls, and half of my country is hell bent on never ever investing in others as a rule.

100% agree. Massive challenge, especially in a system of government which is basically just ""rolling elections"" every other year and where representatives have to spend more time fundraising than legislating just so they can keep their seats. There is certainly a debate to be had over whether some short term measures to prevent immediate harm from gun violence might be necessary, in part because of the difficulty of enacting longer-term reform, but I definitely take your point about the issues with doing so in America.

I do think it's a shame that these conversations don't happen in the public space with a bit more recognition of the complexities and nuances. To circle back to where we started, people arguing that the US should just copy the Australian model are being a little too dogmatic. Similarly, the kinds of stories we hear about Australia creeping towards authoritarianism aren't really reflective of what life is actually like for Australians. The truth is perhaps that the two countries have different problems with different solutions.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
616,"Ok. Gaza wasn't given to Palestinian. They were pushed back there because they kept attacking Israel. 

Israelis losing their homes, don't get ""new homes"". They still own the land, but they have to rebuild themself, out of their pocket. They don't get new homes, idk where you get your info. Even the west Bank settlers buy the homes that they live in.

I'm not trying to justify settler agenda. They are not contributing to the peace effort.

Settlers are a serious problem that you have to understand has opposition inside the Israeli government, and it's almost 50% 50%. Saying ""Israel bad"" is not correct. There is a trump like guy sitting in office.

It's like I would take what these MAGA people have done over the last years and compare that to all of America, like saying everyone in America is white racist gun shooting truck driving cowabanga hillbilly incest people from Alabama.

You only see the bad news. You dont hear about Gazans and Palestinians working in Israel. You hear about hate and violence.

Who would think we can allow our citizens to maintain their right to bear arms while simultaneously fostering a society with living wages, affordable health care for all (including robust mental health services), police accountability, etc???

618,"&gt;You totally can. And it's much harder to sneak a box truck into a school and then kill 30 people in 30 seconds at long range

30 people in 30 second is something not even the most trained special forces person can do. Too many john wick movies for you.

&gt;without the ability to retaliate. You make it harder for them to do, and the effect lesser if they still do it, and you'll have less deaths as a result.

No you have less gun fatalities, not less fatalities. In the world of crazy people they will still attempt to achieve the same goal - ""as many people as possible"". An ability to retaliate is allowing gun ownership and not suppressing it. You do not hear of the ""good guy with a gun"" scenarios because the police are demonized. And when a citizen with a gun stops an event, the media doesn't care because it was a single injury/death and not something that they can sell or feed you.

&gt;Mass shootings aren't the only gun fatalities, just the most egregious and shocking ones.

So a person attempting to commitment suicide will say ""aw shucks, I can't kill myself now because I only can have 10 bullets""? Mass shootings are only egregious because there is no one there to stop them and occur in safe spaces that are ""gun free"". These are targets chosen for specific reasons: there is no one there to fight back. There only people that can are 5 to 7 minutes away. It's like a party.

&gt;That you don't give a damn that dozens of people can instantly lose their lives in minutes in one place in one instance is pretty damning. That you're against lowering fatalities is pretty telling.

You're barking up the wrong tree. Violence starts from three places: mental illness, crime and disagreements. Disagreements get out of hand and not something that can be prevented. Crime can only be suppressed through tougher policing on violent offenders and those associated with violent offenders. How many of these incidents were caused by felons who shouldn't have been on the street in the first place? Finally we get to mental illness. If we actually had a strong mental health system in place, red flag laws would actually be effective. If people, like the family of the recent Colorado shooter had actually taken measures it would have never happened. They are equally culpable in what happened and are shedding responsibility.

That's the thing, no one wants to be held responsible for their own actions or what they contributed to. If you told me that banning guns would decrease violence I would call you a phony: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/24/bidens-claim-that-1994-assault-weapons-law-brought-down-mass-shootings/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/24/bidens-claim-that-1994-assault-weapons-law-brought-down-mass-shootings/)

&gt;Driving licenses, mandatory insurance in case you hurt someone, drunk driving laws, the existance of speed limits.

People still drive with suspended licenses or no licenses at all. Lets make it so you need to insert your drivers license to start the car. Same goes for insurance. It's illegal to drive drunk, we have the tech why not install a breathalyzer? You've never sped before? Better add cameras to cars to make sure you can't speed. At what point does ""common sense"" turn into non-sese.

&gt;Countries with higher hurdles to getting a driving license do in fact have lower fatalities. Oh, ever heard of mother against drunk driving? What were the vehicle fatality statistics before they banned a bunch of stuff? Lower?

The hurdles are not high enough and the penalities are either not enforced or not enough to be effective.

&gt;You can at the same time be pro gun legislation, pro vehicle legislation AND even pro healthcare legislation to TRIPLE the lowering of fatalities that could be avoided. Crazy idea, I know.

Two of the three of those could actually do something to move a needle on numbers. Gun legislation, specifically the ones you've referenced in other posts will not move any needle. It would make people feel safer because they think they have more laws to help protect them from big scary guns when the actual threat is prolific crime (obviously don't care about the law) and self inflicted harm. Frankly, you're more likely to die from a foot fungus than a bullet in America, but don't let the media know that: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131223181303.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131223181303.htm) .

623,"**Here are some quick statistics on gun violence in America:**

In 2018, there were roughly 40,000 gun related deaths, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.0122% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those roughly 40,000 deaths:

• 24,000 (60%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)

• 1,000 (2.5%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 500 (1.25%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 40,000 annually, but rather roughly 13,500... 0.004% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location. According to a review of FBI homicide statistics (6), the 10 cities with the highest firearm homicide rates (Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, Louisville, Milwaukee, St.Louis, Baltimore, Birmingham, Memphis, and New Orleans) make up roughly 20% of those deaths.

This leaves 10,800 deaths for everywhere else in America... about 200 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 10,000 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)

You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)

Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 62% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14

Page 15:

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.

Griggers, 28, who was fired by the Wilkinson County Sheriff’s Office last November, faces up to 10 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and will never work as a police officer again.

Good job getting the guilty verdict, federal agents. Black people in Georgia should not live in fear of getting beaten up by the deputy sheriff.

But why would he talk that way?  What is his real mindset?

627,"&gt;&gt;For reference ~0.003% of the American population died due to firearms, including suicide, in 2019. While ~0.0003% of the UK's population died from knife related homicides in 2019, this excludes any knife related homicides the Greater Manchester Police may have recorded as well as suicides. 

&gt;Right, so your gun crime is 10x our knife crime. 

A little under ~2x when we view the comparable data, which is interesting. In fact if we removed gang violence, including the mafias and cartels, from both figures the UK would be far worse than America. 

&gt;Supports my point, no?

That's total gun deaths attributed to firearms in America, including suicides and accidental deaths, etc. ~61.5% of all firearm deaths in America are suicides. UK figures excluded any data from Greater Manchester, which is over 4% of the population, as well as knife related suicides or accidentals for the entire nation. I was very clear on this. It's interesting that ""knife crimes"" have risen in the UK over the last six years while firearm related crimes in America have declined. So I'm uncertain if your point was based in any factual evidence. 

&gt;And yeah, our kids are educated on the dangers of knife crime, as they should be. What's your point?

Do you train them to hide or help?",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
628,Bans don't work. You can't deny mexico. Venezuela and brazil with far stricter laws than Australia by a mile were helped too. The usa passed gun reform before Australia that was sweeping. In the usa. Gun violence is gang related or suicides. Our gun violence comes from few crime ridden cities with strict carry laws and gun regulation. These reforms would never solve the issue in America. Australia had substantially lower amounts of firearms. They also rely on imports. The usa is connected to mexico. Im fine with gun control in Australia but I have issue when such plans are pushed on America. It would get more killed. Canada is a perfect example. They banned most semiautomatic rifles and soon handguns and airsoft yet still see huge jumps in gun violence.,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because it seems you didn't. All of those things are addressed.

If you pick and choose which parts of data you're willing to use, you could argue that there's zero gun violence in America if you exclude everything but blunderbusses.

632,"&gt;What do you think could also help?

There has to be a multi-pronged approach to gun violence in America. Mental health accessments, mandatory gun registration and background checks for all gun purchases, red flag laws, firearms proficiency training and evaluation are all measures desigb
ned to lower incidents of gun violence.

I speak from a background as a lifelong gun owner having been around firearms since going deer hunting with my father at the ripe age of seven. In both the military and as a correctional officer I was instructed on the proper use of deadly weaponry. And we were required to requalify and demonstrate a continued proficiency. Why are we not equally concerned our private citizens are also proficient and properly trained? 

Franklin Roosevelt’s National Firearms Act of 1934 was aimed at John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, and other murderous gangsters. The president was insistent on removing machine guns from the hands of those with little regard for human life. Did the ban on that specific weaponry make Americans less safe and unable to defend themselves and their family? No.

There remained a plethora of other weaponry that still provided a substantial level of protection for those exercising their 2nd Amendment right. But today their remains staunch opposition to doing the same thing with specific military style weaponry employing large capacity clips. 

My ability to defend my home and family would not be impacted by a new ban. I would not be required to give up any firearms I currently own. I would still have access to hundreds of various firearms entirely capable of meeting my needs.

Until we are honest that making concessions and tightening gun regulations are in the best interest of our country collectively we will never make progress towards gun death mitigation. If we are unwilling to make any meaningful changes we should stop with the handwringing and thoughts and prayers after each new mass shooting event.

The reality is the U.S. comprises just 5% of the world population but we suffer nearly 40% of worldwide mass shooting events. That statistic should be sobering to anyone genuinely concerned. Seventy percent of Americans want mandatory background checks for all gun purchases. But our representatives cater to the special interest groups. American politics has failed its constitutients.

I certainly agree with many of your suggestions like overhauling our police departments, and especially identify with your concerns about being involved at the community level. We need to freely communicate with our neighbors. As a liberal living in rural America I have conservative friends and neighbors. We do not agree on a lot of issues but we all think gun violence and death is helping to destroy the fabric of our society. The status quo has become an embarrassment.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
633,"There are a lot of issues at play, but the E.U. Homicide rate is of course going to be lower since there aren’t as many guns. But the incidence of people being harassed, or whatever like many people here have described escapes the statistics. They’re lower risk activities for scumbags because nobody is going to shoot you in Europe for it. In America they will.

Also much of the crime your talking about, especially gun homicides is gang on gang violence which, I don’t care too much about. I care more about regular people being safe and able to walk down the street without being harassed. 

So the whole “added bonus of being shot” is kind of lame. And I would still prefer firearms here versus Europe where there’s no chance I can defend myself. 

And before you go down a path of painting me in some light that’s not true, I’m pretty left leaning. I just support guns too. 

Also, I don’t accept E.U. Versus U.S. comparisons. It makes no sense to compare 28 different countries (or whatever the E.U. is at now) to a single country.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
634,"""Gun violence""* is really a combination of multiple problems including suicide, mental health issues, drug addiction &amp; trade, and gang violence. 

Instead of focusing on the same tired ineffective gun policies focus on social policies, I suggest: 

* Comprehensive Mental Health Care reform with an emphasis on suicide prevention and increasing access and availability of support and counselling. 

* Create a nationally funded suicide hotline for immediate counseling and advertise it heavily through radio, TV, billboard, and internet ads. **Update: They did it! Dial 988 if you need help!** 

* Create a CDC suicide prevention task force to have small groups of mental health professionals go around the country providing free counseling, mental health evaluations, and support. 

* Create education subsidies and grants for those pursuing careers in the mental health field that agree to spend a designated time after graduation working in rural communities. There are similar programs for medical doctors. 

* Launch a comprehensive CDC study of common psychological drugs to determine potential risks for violent behavior associated with their use. 

* Create a national program to temporarily surrender your firearms at any police station for 72 hours. 

* Implement a national counseling app produced by the US Department of Education, for students K through 12 as well as College, that provides counseling resources including face to face tele-counseling to provide nationwide counseling resources for all students. 

* Federal Tax credits for gun safes and annual gun safety courses. 

* Real gun safety education elective courses in high school, like drivers ed. 

* Legalize and regulate marijuana in America in the style of alcohol. Apply a 20% tax rate with all tax revenues ear marked for education in the zip code collected. 

* Create a national work program focused on rebuilding the crumbling infrastructure in America with a recruiting campaign targeting low income high crime areas. Not unlike the Civilian Conservation Corp. 

* Federally mandate all uniformed peace officers and agents to have an active body cam during working hours. 

* Create a federal FBI task force to independently investigate all police shootings and determine their validity. 

* Disband the ATF and give their duties to the FBI with increased funding. 

* Enact and enforce mandatory minimums, 10 year per gun and 1 year per bullet, for all prohibited persons found guilty of committing a property or violent crime with an illegally possessed firearms unless they cooperate with investigators to identify and testify against who supplied them the illegal guns and ammunition to help end straw purchases. 

* Create a multi agency task force to target know gang members for tax evasion through the IRS. How they got Capone.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

636,"Criminals can easily get guns in a country where guns are ubiquitous. Someone who _becomes_ a criminal in their intent is more likely to become a criminal with a gun in a society where a large percentage of people own guns.

Gun ownership is extremely common in the U.S. compared to other high development index nations.

Without even getting into questions of policy shift, America needs a healthier relationship with firearms. If people simply stopped buying them so much when they don't need them, as a simple matter of culture, the gun violence issue would almost certainly improve.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
637,"The world changes. Publics don't have the appetite for war and balk at the very idea of casualties and as democracy spreads that becomes a very real hurdle to climb.

Pull outs of Iraq and Afghanistan were due to unpopularity, Libya was given a half measure that made everything worse because democracies wouldn't risk boots on the ground casualties, pick any of a hundred conflicts that are going on right now without intervention because voting publics do not want to see flag draped coffins for anything other than national defence at this point.

America spent the 20th century doing very well out of might makes right but is now facing serious backlash across the world as it comes back around and people object to the threats and interference. The EU has at least started to demonstrate alternative methods of diplomacy that aren't backed by a gun, and China has had a good few years undermining the US and spreading influence without having to even mention violence.

638,"&gt;Biden will direct the administration to begin the process of requiring buyers of so-called ghost guns — homemade or makeshift firearms that lack serial numbers — to undergo background checks, according to three people who have spoken to the White House about the plans. He is expected to be joined at the event by Attorney General Merrick Garland. 

This is pretty wide and open to interpretation, so I'll give two possible interpretations of this statement:

1: Biden wants to require background checks whenever homemade unserialized firearms are transferred. To my knowledge (and please correct me if I'm wrong) it's already illegal to transfer a firearm that does not have a serial number. So this is criminalising something that's already a crime. Good job.

2: Biden wants to require background checks on the purchase of kits like a P80. Which is going to do effectively nothing since I'd wager the majority if not the vast majority of homebuilt firearms are printed, not cut.

&gt;But stakeholders have speculated that the president could announce regulations on concealed assault-style firearms;

It's already illegal to conceal a long gun.

&gt;prohibitions on firearm purchases for those convicted of domestic violence against their partners;

Already illegal.

&gt;and federal guidance on home storage safety measures.

Just another attempt to price poor people out of firearms ownership. What a cunt.

&gt;Biden is likely to make the same point on Thursday, in addition to  expressing support for bills to expand background checks and close the  so-called Charleston loophole that allows a gun to be transferred from  licensed gun dealers before a completed background check.

The ""Charleston loophole"" is the requirement that if a background check does not return within three days the seller is allowed to complete the transfer of a weapon. This exists as a protection against the government enacting a *de facto* ban on firearm sales by simply refusing to return background checks. It is critical that any attack on this protection is fought tooth and nail.

&gt;He also is likely to push for legislation to keep guns away from people believed to be a danger to themselves or others

A term as ill-defined as ever, I see.

&gt;as well as a ban of assault weapons and high capacity magazines.

Molon labe.

&gt;Community-based groups cheered Biden’s decision to include $5 billion  for community violence prevention programs in the $2 trillion  infrastructure package he unveiled last week.

Welcome to America, where a $2,000Bn ""infrastructure bill"" contains $150Bn for infrastructure.

Fuck me.

&gt;After the shooting in Newtown, Conn., President Barack Obama asked his  then vice president to push through what he had hoped would be the  biggest firearms restrictions since the Clinton administration. But  after months of meetings and limited executive actions, a bill to  require expanded background checks died on the Senate floor.

So that's the final nail in the coffin of the leftists that keep screeching ""bUt ObAmA dIdNt SiGn AnY gUn CoNtRoL""",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anyway.

In America, you'd almost never know that person you meet is concealed carrying and has a gun under their shirt.  Because by law ""concealed"" means NOT detectable.  

Also, and for all the violence and mass shootings in America, it's NOT the lawful-abiding gun owners committing those acts.

Then we get covid relief passed, get the vaccine process organized finally, then get economic benefits passed to get the economy going. 

Then finally get actual progressive democrats in congress in the midterms and get Medicare for All passed and end the drug war and legalize drugs and raise the minimum wage etc etc.

Which in my opinion ENDs gun violence in America. We need to stop the cause of why people are angry and crazy and poor and violent. Poor, angry, mentally unstable people are much more violent than not poor, happier, mentally stable people.

I hate to say this, but it really appears that most news outlets don't give a shit about when the shooter is a PoC. See Muskogee (Feb 2nd), Indianapolis (Jan 24th), and Chicago (Jan 9th). Each incident left six people dead and each has a suspect in custody who is a person of color. And yet the Atlanta shooting last month was branded ""the first mass shooting since lock down began"". I don't necessarily believe that media outlets are racist and only willing to report when white people commit crimes. But I do believe that they are only inclined to report stories that are sensational to the current culture and will boost ratings. Which unfortunately, heavily distorts the publics perception of gun violence in America. White males are not solely responsible for mass shootings in this country.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was pretty evident you didn't know the stats. 

&gt;u just focused on the welfare part for some reason. But I guess I'm a, what'd u say? A white liberal would say to avoid giving tangibles. Nigga what the FUCK does that mean . 

Because the aid of welfare from the state doesn't negate the poverty faced. White liberals use this as an tactic to not give proper aid to the Black community. 

&gt;I wrote three hundred and forty six comments all about how is minorities have been used and laws been twisted agaianst us and the basis of those laws is fucked up in the first place ,

Now generate some more comments, but this time get into the racist history of disarming Black people by both white liberals and conservatives America.

&gt;but because I said Americans in the US get welfare I'm saying shit as a , fuck the white part I'm not even gonna go into the goofiness of how u arrived there , liberal to avoid giving Tangibles. That's a fucking annoying ass sentence. 

Black folks demanding tangibles that other groups exclusively received usually annoys everyone....since the end of slavery basically. Right now we have to remind Biden we saved him in Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania so he can actually propose more policies like he does for everyone else. And it's not fuck the white part but Black gun violence is a huge chunk of gun homicides along with gun crimes in the States. If our community got fixed up the issue would drop dramatically on the world stage. 

Essentially mass shootings make up the least of the gun crimes but the most resources goes towards that topic because it affects white people(along with the State wanting to disarm citizens) this recent plea by Jim Crow Joe is the first time policies were crafted with the Black community where it didn't involve locking us up and getting to the root of the problem.

646,"Police departments lay out ""use of force"" standards in their General Orders. Meaning a large book, it's usually massive sized, on the department structure and regulations. 

Use of force operates on a ""continuum"", it's not some tiered checklist. 

If an officer feels their lives are in danger or the lives of the public are in danger, they can draw their weapon based on their department General Orders. Determining when your life is in danger is not some script specific scenario. The person could be armed, the person could be armed with something other than a gun, the person could not be armed at all. If the threat is a 6'5 former football player and the officer is a 5'1 female, there is going to be some calibration in what reasonable person might look at what would make someone feel endangered. 

Listing when and when not specifically a police officer can unholster their firearm is NOT a practical way to do this job and to maintain the officer's safety and the public's safety. 

What I just described is how use of force will be seen to a legal standard. You could argue with me all day and it's your opinion and you right to it, but this is how the actual court system and legal system will evaluate law enforcement use of force. The general public does not typically understand the legal standards of how use of force operates to the law. 

This officer clearly made a mistake. A big one, but a mistake. There is an erroneous narrative out there that police officers are just out there executing people at will. Esp black Americans. At any given point, there are between 800K to 850K active sworn law enforcement patrolling the streets of America. By and large, most of those people are just like people here - Doing their best and trying to feed their families. Some are excellent at their job, most are average and a small percentage are horrible at it. But this is true for any profession. 

This officer will have to pay for her mistake. She will lose her job. And her pension. And she will have to live with the events the rest of her life. Very likely she will be part of a massive civil suit. But for criminal action, the court will look at intent. Was she going out there with malice and looking to shoot someone? The evidence will very likely not bear that out. 

And there is no excuse for the rioting and looting. That hurts average everyday Americans, many of those small business owners are minorities. Also with the pandemic and lockdowns, many are suffering already financially. You don't approach a tragedy by creating more tragedy. If people can't work because the business is burned to the ground, they can't feed their kids. They can't pay rent. Lots of people are going to end up homeless because of the economic devastation of the pandemic plus the rioting. 

I think AOC is a fascinating political figure in that she has a massive platform for such a young age. Her situation is incredibly rare. But I want to be fair, she doesn't have a background in law and the legal system. Like many Americans, she simply doesn't fully understand how the court and legal system will see and rule on law enforcement use of force. 

This is a tragedy. But it was also clearly a mistake. A horrible mistake but still a mistake. It's easy for the rest of us to look into the mind of a split second decision where someone made that mistake. She shouts ""Taser"" but draws her firearm. Not everything that happens negatively to a black American is racist and not everything is some kind of statement against black Americans as a whole. 

Charles Barkley and Chris Rock have both come out in the past and urged black America, esp young black males, to simply comply with the police and if the situation is negative, call a lawyer later. They both have said no argument is worth your life or risk of violence or physical altercation and there's no way you are going win that fight. And this isn't just for black America, it's for everyone. Comply, even if it's not fair, and then call a lawyer. 

I will very likely be downvoted to oblivion but that is also part of the problem. Many people demand answers and then will ignore the ones they just don't like, even if there is a practical and legal basis in what is being said, tragedy or not. This a tragedy. I am sorry for this person's family. But I'm also sorry for this officer, who has to live with this, and the entire community, who don't deserve to have their neighborhoods to be looted and burned down.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; NYC highschool encourages parents to reflect on their whiteness and become'white traitors' 

Interesting read.

&gt; In between the two extreme “identities” of supremacist and abolitionist  are such categories as “White Voyeurism’’ — defined as “wouldn’t  challenge a white supremacist, desires non-whiteness because it’s  interesting’’ — and “White Privilege,’’ or “sympathetic to a set of  issues but only privately; won’t speak/act in solidarity publicly  because benefitting through whiteness in public (some POC are in this  category as well).” 

I do have to ask were the person is wrong in this statement?  It may not be the most eloquently stated opinion but it is based on actual behaviors and actions by people. I literally only have to point to the fact Trump pushed the literal racists birther movement and conservatives were more then willing to support him and elected him as their Presidential nominee and then President.  But Steven King is/was a Republican congressman with ties to literal white supremacists and he was elected and reelected for years.

&gt; North Carolina teacher's conference that encourages ~~parents~~ *teachers* to push racist 'anti-racist' ideology onto kids and just ignore parents who raise concerns. 

To start off

&gt; The February 2020 conference, attended by more than 200 North Carolina  public school teachers, began with a “land acknowledgement,” a ritual  recognition suggesting that white North Carolinians are colonizers on  stolen Native American land 

There is nothing to suggest. This is literally what happened.  Native Americans settled North America hundred of years before European colonist showed up.  And those colonists treated Natives pretty poorly including stealing land. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; At the first session, “Whiteness in Ed Spaces,” school administrators  provided two handouts on the “norms of whiteness.” These documents  claimed that “(white) cultural values” include “denial,” “fear,”  “blame,” “control,” “punishment,” “scarcity,” and “one-dimensional  thinking.” According to notes from the session, the teachers argued that  “whiteness perpetuates the system” of injustice and that the district’s  “whitewashed curriculum” was “doing real harm to our students and  educators.” The group encouraged white teachers to “challenge the  dominant ideology” of whiteness and “disrupt” white culture in the  classroom through a series of “transformational interventions.” 

So were is this wrong? I simply have to point to Black Lives Matter were black people were protesting the abuse and mistreatment of black people by police as if they didn't matter. Only to be met with the thin blue line and all lives matter folks who formed specifically to undermine and invalidate their complaints.  


I can't think of or find any public polices to address police abuse being pushed or supported by All Lives Matter group.  If you know of one please share it.

&gt;Kamala Harris fundraised to help bail out rioters, including violent domestic abusers

 

* The Minnesota Freedom Fund helped bail out  of jail six men accused of domestic violence between June and August,  court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show. 

This article was posted September. So how was the  Freedom Fund group suppose to know previous convictions?

&gt; Since the uprising, we have paid $3,475,000 for county bails with  $210,000 of that being used for protest-related bails that we were able  to support. We feel urgency attached to every bail request but are  working our way through the high volume of referrals with care.  

The MFF wasn't created with the protests or riots in mind. It has been around for a lot longer. So how is it bad that the majority of the money and the primary reason for it's creation was used for none riot or protest based bails? I mean they have literally been around since 2016. So your source trying to use the fact only a small portion for riots and protestors is simply disingenuous.

The guy was unarmed and he reacted to a pistol shot into the air by someone else near by. On top of that the kid shouldn't even have been there. He wasn't protecting family property. He was wondering around alone with a gun. The definition of white privilege.  You don't need an automatic rifle slung over your shoulders for self defense. You only do that if you are hunting or trying to intimidate people.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; No, because the the argument against gun control is not 'I have the right to kill an innocent human being.' 

If you ban guns people will just get guns anyways. Just like if you ban abortions people will just get them anyways.

649,"It's not a human right in Australia, France, Germany and Norway.

The ""human right to bear arms"" is only in 3 countries, 2 being in South America and America itself.
Serbia, Yemen, Switzerland, and Saudi Arabia have guns but it is not a human right. 

7 countries out of 195 countries have guns, do you ever question why that is?

In Canada there where 13,168 cases of gun violence spaning from 2000-2016. In America there where 14,400 deaths from guns in 2019 alone.

And Canada doesn't completely outlaw guns. ""Firearms are federally regulated in Canada. The federal 1977 Criminal Law Amendment Act, as amended, prohibits automatic weapons and sawed-off shotguns and rifles.

651,"I always describe this movie as one of if not the first movie that taught me that movies could be cinema.

John Singleton, and Spike Lee’s movies in the very early 90s had a huge impact on me as a young person. I had a complicated childhood but, suffice it to say I suffered through racism on a daily basis, and I could strongly relate to these films despite not being black, and living deep in Appalachia rather than an urban area. I could connect with many of these movies due to myself sharing similarities with many of the characters within them such as no father or, at times, a step-father or man being around who was far from an ideal male role model, being raised by grandmothers, having children who lived nearby always eating at one house because their own lacked any, always surrounded by gun culture, physical violence, and alcohol were always present in place of drugs like crack. Movies like this, and sitcoms featuring a primarily black cast allowed these characters to fill in in areas where I personally was missing someone in my life like a father because, as I’m sure many have noticed, non-POC fathers in media, especially in television, and commercials, are often always written as buffoons where as in black filmography the adult characters always stressed the importance of honor, integrity, keeping your word, wisdom, and personal strength — the only other place I found that was in comic books.

Movies like this offered insight into the lives of people that middle-class America had either been unaware of or simply ignored, and had always hand-waved off with one racist epithet or another. However, unbeknownst to many, it did more than just that, it gave an insight into what it is like to be poor in America, and how the poor are misunderstood, abused, hated, and how much they suffer in the land of plenty. Moreover, these movies provided guides; they demonstrated that you have to help yourself before you can truly help others, this movie in particular demonstrated that without knowledge, and wisdom you will always be trapped in a cycle of poverty, and all that entails.

While Appalachia, outside of coal mining, is often forgotten or ridiculed by a majority of the country, the similarities between areas within it, and the poverty stricken areas within urban areas were, to my young eyes, and mind, uncanny.

The tragic part, to me, is that while I suffered similarly as the characters within these movies, as many others do in America, and elsewhere, the simple truth is that I could one day move, and I would be treated with decency wherever I moved to whereas a black person may not escape their treatment so “easily.”",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
652,"

&gt; I am for voluntary transactions. If someone shows up with a gun(state coercion) they are the asshole. I’ll ask again.


I suggest you read up on labor history in the U.S.  Howard Zinns *A Peoples History* would be a good place to start.  Cause what tends to happen is that successful worker strikes are cracked down upon violently by the police and the employer.  In the case of Amazon, millions were spent to stop this union drive - including Amazon getting the city to remove the traffic light where union pamphlets were being handed out, and paying off duty police officers to hang around.  In the U.S., the state coercion has *always* been targeted at the left and to the benefit of the capitalists.


&gt; I’ll ask again. If the U.S. has a top down system as you claim, who at the top selected Jeff Bezos to be the worlds richest man? Who decided your job and your pay?


You think I'm saying there's someone at the top who hand picked Jeff Bezos to be rich? Of course not.  That doesn't mean our system isn't top down, and I think you'd be hard pressed to say Amazon (or any large company, which is where most people spend most their time) is bottom up.  Jeff Bezos did extraordinarily well in the capitalist system, but his success relies on that system.  The entire idea of intellectual property rights, backed up by law, meaning state violence, is required for an individual like Bezos to see the wealth he has.  In the U.S., we have a constitution that was written by a wealthy minority who feared their wealth being taken away.  You can read the founding fathers stating that the purpose of the Senate is to be a bulwark against democracy.  So we have an entire system of laws essentially written by the wealthy which is backed up by a state police force under the threat of violence.  Its why Amazon can get away with paying zero dollars in taxes for instance.


&gt; My point on Spain wasn’t specific to Spain.


Well yeah, it wasn't relevant to Spain even


&gt; However where socialists haven’t been thwarted by external influences they have always succumbed to your “right wingers” within their own movement. That isn’t a bug it’s a feature.


Well, how about U.S. intervention in South America during the Cold War?  It's been explicitly stated that Liberation Theology is not in the interests of the U.S. state, and was consequently crushed.  There are a plethora of examples of capitalist states violently squashing left wing egalitarian movements.  The reason is simple and is said out loud by state representatives, these movements are not in the interests of the U.S.  In other words, a socialist movement is not good for the profits of the people who are rich enough (through a capitalist system) to have a sway over our armed, state forces. 

I want to ask you, does our current system rely on state coercion? I think it clearly does.  Whats your thoughts on banks for instance, or charging interest on loans in general?",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
653,"All I can say is that the majority of us in America *know* that our gun culture is out of control and a danger to us. And frankly to other countries. 

Fewer, but still probably the majority know we need gun control. 

The problem is that here in America we are paralyzed due to a wildly corrupt and sociopathic political party who are stopping any and all efforts to stop gun violence. 

We'll get to gun control one day. We just need another few hundred thousand people to be slaughtered before the urgency finally breaks through years of propaganda indoctrination.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
654,"When a gun becomes easier to obtain illegally than legally is when you have a problem. I've never been anti gun laws I agree with you for the most part and obviously they should exist but laws that just take away certain kinds of firearms and pretend like its helped with the issue in any capacity and laws that make it harder for innocent civilians to get a firearm but doesn't change how hard it is for criminals/the mentally ill much is wrong. Your just moving the goal post back for **everyone** and keeping it equal, we don't need to make it equally as hard for **everyone** innocent and bad to obtain a firearm we need the ratio between law abiding citizens with firearms to be higher instead.

If you want to talk about statistics states with the lowest guns (strictest gun laws) vs the highest have more violence, criminals and the mentally ill are more ""brave"" when they know there victim is defenseless and vulnerable, I'd rather live in a state where most people own a firearm then where far and few in between do because I'm actually less likely to be shot despite the increase in guns. Funny how that works right?

As for other countries; Sweden is better in America in almost every way. There culture, there citizens are smarter, justice system, government, they're not nearly as corrupt and hellbent on making a very controllable populace. They handle mental health much better and people in prison actually get rehabilitated. All of these factors lead to a much more intelligent, happy and civilized society. Murder there is overall lower not just gun violence which points to the truth; much less people there want to commit murder or mass murder, there country isn't dysfunctional and doesn't use propaganda every other day. America has the highest incarceration rate than any other 1st world country even higher than china a communist country with over 2x the population. 300 milion citizens incarcerated more than 1 billion citizens in a communist country... These statistics are rivaling 3rd world countries.

I'm not disagreeing with you that Sweden has good laws but my point is if we are making it legally just as hard for everyone we're not fixing the problem were escalating it, getting a gun illegally should always be harder than getting it legally and it should be harder for someone with bad intent to get a firearm than someone with good intent not equally. But the problem is we can't make laws like this, because Republicans don't want any laws passed and Democrats just want to pass the strictest toughest gun laws banning almost every type of gun and magazine based off looks and turn every single state into new york city a violent shithole. I'm not interested in that, we need more competent parties dems and repubs are filled with emotional children with outdated ideas from 60 years ago. The scariest thing is though even with some really good gun laws our countries issues stem much deeper than that, we are just more violent and less happy than countries like Sweden in general, we need to change so many things about ourselves if we want overall violence to be lower. I'll give some examples

1. Focus on rehabilitating people in prison more than sending them out worse than when they came in
2. Restore trust between police and citizens, hold them accountable
3. Restore faith in the justice system, no more innocent people imprisoned for silly crimes or baseless accusations
4. Restore faith in our parties, dems and repubs playing waiting games screwing with every citizens lives, acting immature, not getting things done, etc
5. Be less divisive, instead of being extremely far left and right lets be reasonable people and find middle ground, lets not be at each other peoples throats (politicians and citizens)
6. Regulations on media: media basically controls every election. Whoever they talk about the most is the front runner, they know this. Every year I can tell you the two candidates that we will have to choose between, they have too much influence on what we think and how we behave
7. Ban lobbying: presidents can no longer accept deals however as a result they will be paid more annually, politicians (senators, congressmen) will no longer be able to pass laws for monetary gain from a companies wallet. Restore faith that the laws we pass are coming from these peoples actual hearts and not from there greed
8. Analyst. Whenever there is a conflict or an issue have professional anaylist analyze what the issue is and things other countries have done to combat it, do tests, surveys, see what's been proven to work and what doesnt. Let's take an intelligent approach to solving our problems instead of an emotional one. This information will be relayed to the senate congress and the president.
9. Term limits. People struggle to adapt to the quickly changing world, we don't need old politicans using dated ideas for modern problems or trying to keep the world from changing because they aren't comfortable with it. Have you heard politicans interview mark Mark Zuckerberg and google? They know absolutely nothing about the internet but they're the ones making laws on it. Their incompetent on the things most important to modern society, term limits ASAP
10. End the drug war, stop kicking down doors shooting people's pets and breaking apart families because someone was peacefully smoking a plant in there house. This basically goes for every victimless crime where the police interaction is more dangerous and violent than the act itself.
11. Drug users (prescription, hard drugs, not drugs like weed) shouldn't be treated as a criminal problem or shamed by society, we want them to seek help without fear of being arrested or anything.
12. Healthcare. We spent more on health care than other counties that have free health care (per capita) yet it isn't free, and that's because we are using our healthcare system as a revenue source instead. I remember having two medicines that were a few bucks, one stopped producing there's and the other one all of a sudden went up to $200. I couldn't afford it, they didn't get punished for it. This is the type of stuff that only happens in America

These are just some of the problems and some ideas for them. I know I've strayed away from gun violence but I think the first step in the right direction is creating a less criminal, violent society to begin with then creating some useful gun laws. Emphasis on useful though, don't just ban every weapon based off looks like Democrats want to do, don't use terms like ""fully semi-automatic"" to fear monger.

TL;DR: This is too important to shorten so if you didn't read I hope you have a good day and if you only read part of it please don't respond just continue on",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
655,"I disagree because I live in Canada and Australia changing their laws pretty much completely stopped mass shootings they were experiencing and gun violence in general is low. The bottom line is when guns are less available and prominent there are less shootings. I think America has both a gun culture problem and a gun control problem. I have maybe seen 2 guns in my entire life in Canada that weren’t hunting rifles, I went to Texas and that number got blown away in one day at a fair mostly for meant for children. In Canadian culture we don’t grow up shooting guns, there just isn’t a huge demand for guns and since there aren’t less guns on the street there is less gun crime. I honestly think even if the US implemented assault rifle bans or whatever you guys would still have a huge problem because of the sheer amount of guns in the country and how accessible they are to the average person. That being said changing gun laws are a start.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Republicans’ united opposition to every initiative President Biden has put forth appears to have been a historic blunder. According to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll, “Overall, around three in four Americans approve of how Biden is handling the distribution of coronavirus vaccines (75%) and the response to the virus itself (72%). Sixty percent approve of how Biden is handling the country’s economic recovery.” On the vaccine rollout, even 53 percent of Republicans approve of his performance.

On the economy, 60 percent of Americans approve of Biden’s performance, including 63 percent of independents. And on guns, Biden and the Democrats have a distinct advantage. “By a two-to-one margin, more Americans say enacting new laws to try to reduce gun violence is the higher priority at the moment,” the poll says. “There is widespread agreement on this issue, with Americans of all ages, education levels, racial or ethnic backgrounds, and from all regions in agreement.” Republicans are outside that consensus, although even among them, more than a third favor enacting new laws.

Whether on the vaccine, the coronavirus relief package or guns, Biden enjoys a supermajority of public support, one that is not reflected in Congress, where every single Republican opposed the American Rescue Plan. One would think reporters would be pressing GOP congressional leaders on why they are thwarting policies that many of their own voters support. Republicans’ public grousing about the size of the economic package has evidently fallen on deaf ears.

Biden has weaker support on guns, reflecting lower support among Democrats (62 percent approve/37 percent disapprove) who would like stronger action. With Democrats seeking to make a run at universal background checks (an issue that draws 80 percent or more approval), he may be able to boost his numbers on this as well.

It is hardly surprising that after the nonstop hysteria from Republicans, Biden does much worse on immigration (41 percent approve/57 percent disapprove) than on the economy and the pandemic. So far, though, most Americans do not put immigration anywhere near the top of their priorities. Moreover, by placing so much emphasis on this issue, Republicans might be lowering expectations for the president and setting themselves up for the inevitable cyclical downturn in migration.

Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” White House communications director Kate Bedingfield explained that Biden is “using every possible avenue to ensure that we’re getting these kids out of Border Patrol custody and into [Health and Human Services] facilities as quickly as possible” — including opening up the Army’s Fort Bliss and Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.

Given that the “surges are cyclical,” Bedingfield said, “we saw spikes in 2014. We saw them in 2019 when the Trump administration had perhaps the cruelest imaginable policies in place, family separation to try to deter people from coming, and they still came.” (This is consistent with the view of many academics and immigration experts that the uptick began months ago and that higher numbers now reflect that cyclical pattern, plus the effects of two hurricanes last November and pent-up demand during the pandemic.)

If that is correct — that the numbers will trend down in a few months and Biden will have built out the bed capacity — Republicans will be hard-pressed to deny him credit. Moreover, having raised the issue, they will be challenged to approve funding to aid countries in the Northern Triangle of Central America — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

On the issues most on voters’ minds and which Biden prioritized for his first 100 days, he is doing extraordinarily well in the polls. In turning to another area that has strong public support — infrastructure improvement — he may be able once more to paint obstructionist Republicans as out of touch, even with their own base.

Republicans, as they did in the lead-up to their disastrous 2018 midterms (the “caravans”!), will beat the drum on immigration, but ultimately Democrats likely will be judged on whether they can crush the covid-19 pandemic and restore the economy. Once more, Republicans anxious to whip up their base into a fury run the risk of isolating themselves from the concerns and political sentiments of a large majority of Americans.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

660,"Your example is VERY flawed. A person can control their weight and intelligence, even in a country overrun by gun violence.  No, I can't avoid gun violence because I'm stuck living in the US because of some mistakes made when I was in my late teens, plus on top of having a  ascfelony on my record (even though I haven't had a SPEEDING TICKET in more than 20 years) AND being Disabled (although I have a college degree in Psychology) doesn't help, as most 1st world countries want people who will add to the GDP, and many European countries actually have immigration laws that state you can only get a work visa if some ""already living in the country cannot fill the position"", and NO ONE wants someone going straight onto the Disability rolls, educated or not. So I PHYSICALLY CAN'T LEAVE the US as although we ARE now a ""shithole country"" because the right wing GOP Trump fanatics WON'T disarm like rational people would after all the fucking craziness over the past 40 fucking years, and it's stupid anyway, as the original idea of ""the right to bear arms"" was to protect you FROM THE GOVERNMENT- it was the idea that back in the late 1700's, an armed citizenship could overthrow a corrupt government. This is OBVIOUSLY no longer the case. IDC if you armed every person in the Damm US, the government controls so many automated weapons systems and tanks and bombs and misses and shot, that the idea you hunting rifle- or even AR-15 with the locking pin filed down so it won't catch and it will go full auto, IT WOULD HAVE NO NOTICEABLE AFFECT on armored troop carriers and tanks and bombs and drones. So the the REASON for the ""right to bear arms"" no longer exists- or to be more exact the reason is STILL THERE, BUT ""THE 2ND AMMENDMENT"" DOES NOTHING but allow violence and anarchy to rein by allowing a flood of these weapons to gang members, drug deals, and CRAZY AF GOP TRUMPSTERS, which TERRIFY ME more than any gangbanger ever fucking could!!! I mean I'm from Chicago originally- I understand gangs, and trust them to control the streets much more safely and efficiently than ""Chicago Police"" (which is where I'm from, born and raised in probably the most dangerouscity in the country- if you don't know the rules) and the ""Baltimore Police"" (I've lived all over the US, but Baltimore was the last place b4 here) and ""Portland Police"" (which is where I live now) but @ least in Portland we have a leftist mayor and governor who if I don't always agree with, also always disagree with the FEDS, LIKE WHEN WE HAD LIKE 100 DAYS OF RIOTS OVER THE UNWARRANTED EXECUTION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS BY POLICE DEPARTMENTS ALL OVER THE COUNTY, (same thing that happened when I lived in Baltimore, but I was only for about a week.) Trump sent in FEDS, like alphabet boys, HLS, ICE, FBI, etc... And the Mayor and Governor wouldn't let them go out on the the streets and kept telling them they had to leave, never once allowing them outside the Fed Building downtown where people threw rocks and bottles and shot fireworks at the and tried to start fires on the building.

But they're feed such bullshit from such a young age- it's like people that believe in a ""god"" of any sort. ?? ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE EVER ANYWHERE ABOUT ANYTHING AT ALL REGARDING ANYTHING REMOTELY RELATED TO THE BIBLE (except that every major acient culture made up the same type of stories to explain natural phenomenon unknown to them and to control people ""for their own good""- ie: people are dying from eating pork (they don't know its from bacteria in undercooked pork, they just know mothetfuckers are dying when they eat pork.

661,"&gt;Ah yes, because voter registration and guns are perfectly comparable parallels. 

They are rights of American citizens necessary to the success of the proletariat, so there is a line of comparison. If you can't draw a parallel, I can't offer you any more crayons. 

&gt;And by extension, I guess absolutely nothing should be regulated because regulating [insert anything] is just like regulating voter registration, right?

I distinctly, explicitly noted that regulation is fine, but we must utilize caution when developing and applying such regulations. Intellectual dishonesty again, tut tut. 

&gt;Talk about intellectual dishonesty - invalidating any perspective on a generalized concept just because a person holding a sentiment does not spend hours upon hours of their free time developing theoretical restrictions for the sake of argument.

It's not hours, it's one fucking sentence. If you could take the time to type this mess but couldn't come up with a single short description of even the foundation ideal firearm regulations, you have a problem that you don't know what you stand for boss. Figure it out or else you're just going to sound ignorant during these discussions.

&gt;Think of it this way, when someone say ""we need more green energy,"" is your first response ""Oh yeah? What makes you think that? Give me your exact timeline and budgeting of how you plan to eliminate non-renewable energy sources."" 

I do ask ""How do we achieve that?"" Because the BS in Sustainability Science that I'm working through is teaching me to think critically, but hey, we knew from the beginning that that's not always on the table for you. 

&gt;Does everyone need a whole fuckin' plan in order to support some kind of general sentiment towards a green energy initiative?

You do if you want to be a part of the solution instead of crying from the sidelines and doing jack fuck all. The White Moderate cries again. 

Let me be clear: of course you don't have to be able to use your words to support a thing. But you do if you want to be an active part of the solution instead of a bystander. 

&gt;But I regret to inform you, that unlike all the polsci majors circlejerking their superior intellect in this sub, I have not dedicated hours of research into coming up with a definitive plan for gun regulation.

We can tell. I'm sure your gaming time is very important to you. 

&gt;I never said I trust the federal government to implement the perfect discrimination-free gun control regulations. But clearly, the current set of regulations aren't enough considering how many mass shootings we've been experiencing in the past few years. It's either continue down the same shithole path or attempt to do something to remedy the problem.

""I am willing to sacrifice police monopoly of armament and violence in a current administration of oppressive authority because I'm scared of guns."" There it is. That's what I needed. 

&gt;So, state it plainly: ""I would rather let more Americans be killed in mass shootings, so I can continue to live out my far-off paramilitary fantasy of political violence in the distant future.""

""I would rather let more Americans be killed in mass shooting to ensure an armed proletariat."" I have no issues stating it plainly. Cope. 

""Stop having so many kids, fix the ones you have, lock your guns up, consider talking about your feelings occasionally, ""

&gt;Seems to me like you're listing your reasons that gun violence happens right here. Dumb people having kids, dumb people not raising kids right, dumb people not locking their guns up, and lack of therapy.

Well shit, something did sneak through! 

&gt;I see no reference to the immediate availability of guns. So I guess if you weren't implying it, then surely you could just go ahead and let me know now that you also think that the availability of guns is contributing to so many mass shootings in America.

More guns = more access to guns = more incidents with guns. There. Easy shit. 

&gt;What are going to do, create a utopian society with no major mental health issues for any individual?

A slightly more utopian society where people can seek mental health without social stigma and bankrupting themselves is a good start. But you're focused here on one of the cogs in the machine versus the fuel that feeds it. If you cared about gun violence, you'd be preaching about providing mental health to people first and foremost knowing that it's at the root. 

&gt;There's always going to be some psycho out there who absolutely will be a threat to society as a whole if they get their hands on a gun, regardless of how much focus we put on mental health issues. Mental health support will not resolve the issue alone, which is why I feel that at the very least some minor increases to regulation to guns is going to be necessary to truly put this issue to rest.

I hope you find the mental stamina to one day figure out what those regulations are so you can express them effectively. Martha running in circles screaming ""Someone PLEASE think of the children!"" ain't helping boss. 

&gt;Go out, put together a militia, and start gunning down cops if you're gonna be such a badass militant leftist. Walk the walk or shut the fuck up because this is exactly what I've been talking about - everyone's bluffing about their guns. 

I have a court date in April you ignorant dipshit. The ACLU happily put me in touch with a lawyer last year. I'll let you know my verdict because Officer Dumbfuck didn't like me recording him with my Kimber under my arm. Fortunately he's stupid enough that during the deposition he was racist enough to say ""Them Burmese immigrants, they don't always know to pull over, so sometimes you gotta chase em."" 

&gt;You're not gonna do shit against a militarized police state even if you're armed to the teeth with weapons. It's all for show and I am confident it will never be used for anything other than being your little hobby at the gun range.

No, I've got Reaganites like you praising things like the Mulford Act and pretending that the problem will go away eventually. The one thing that got the fascists scared enough to panic was a brown man holding a rifle, and you want to take it from his hands because some theoretical teenager in Midwestern suburbia maybe might steal it and plug his classmates with it because his daddy didn't let him talk about his feelings. 

&gt;I certainly can expect humanity to improve, but to expect that 100% of the population improve to the capacity that they are able to legally own a gun with no threat to others, is just plain and simple, stupid.

Then you misunderstand the concept of an armed proletariat. Nobody's pretending that the threat doesn't exist; the threat is the point. 

&gt;For example, further regulating the types of weapons people can own, what kind of ammunition they can have, how much ammunition they can have, etc. all without some arbitrary concept of judgement based on race.

And yet you STILL can't find the words to express it. When you do, I'm listening. Until then, you can run around preaching about how scared you are of an armed proletariat, and jack shit's gonna change.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
662,"Guns have basically three ... legit  fan bases. 

one - people who like them as machines-cross-history, which show principles of mechanical design through the years. Like - how is a .303 Enfield different from a Garand different from a Maxim different from an M16? This may include collectors. My own interest in guns is as machines, alongside engines and control systems. 

two - People who have to carry as a legitimate part of a job. This will be a ragged cross section of the public, from sworn officers to people who encounter wildlife incidentally to people who handle money ( as in an armored truck ) . 

three - sporting users, whether hunting or competitive shooting. 

Almost no gun ever made will be pointed at another person. 

The real argument against limiting access to guns is that the derivation of arguments for limiting this is to attach all the meaning of violence to the symbolic object . While I can totally see that line of reasoning, I cannot see it as sound.

While we don't have engineering for the neural  science underlying violence , the science has made great strides. A perhaps more effective approach would be to square off with the root causes more than attacking a symbolic object. Of course that also runs up against a whole universe of impossibilities. 

Since you are from Britain, you've seen things about ""knife crime"". I'm trying to be amusing about this, but to an American , it looks like ""first they came for the guns, now they're going after knives."" There are cynical interpretations of this. 

America cannot ban guns because the overwhelming use cases are totally legit. 

It should also be noted that messaging from our NRA seems very fringe and ... dangerous because the NRA chose to embrace any ""pro-gun"" stance in order to prevent schism. 

We Americans also hold to the myth that all deer in Britain were ""the Kings deer"" and that disarmament had a lot to do with that state of affairs. Given our frontier myth, many people like to hunt deer. Arguably the largest dealers in men's clothing in the US are places like Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops, which started out selling hunting-specific clothing but expanded. 

Finally - in WWII Switzerland was able to stay neutral. This is partly because all of Switzerland is uphill, partly because because everyone everywhere needed one neutral party with a high level system of banking and because every Swiss person eligible for military service basically can be assumed to be competent with small arms.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
663,"***Overheaven*** is an alternate history/hard(ish) science-fiction setting, spanning the entire Solar System and 418 years between 1967 and 2385. The timeline starts with the Outer Space Treaty never being signed, there’s a couple million people on Mars by 1999, only a few hundred million people on Earth by 2120, fully-sapient AI by 2020, and mysterious mechanical “salamanders” swimming in the sun searching for the Garden of Eden, in 2385. Humans come in all kinds of flavors after centuries of cybernetics and biomods, there’s about ninety different races of cognitively-uplifted animals (plants, too), and there are turingrades (the aforementioned sapient AI) in a dizzying array of forms. Space is big, there’s no FTL, no synthetic gravity besides spinning or acceleration, laser guns require big clunky batteries on shoulder straps, nanotech isn’t any scarier than programmable microbes, and Orion’s Arm-level god-machines didn’t happen because I’m not writing a fantasy setting here. The big geopolitical players in 2385 are the Martian Alliance (“service guarantees citizenship, senpai”), Jovian Empire (nowhere near as evil as they sound) and the Lunar Covenant (much more evil than they sound). Bit roles include Venus (dinosaurs, flying cities and East German Hindu communists who speak Russian), Mercury (“Many Doors, Ed-Boy”, said the DMT), Saturn (immortal cyborg ghost-pyramids and squid-moons with symbiotic humans on the inside), and an obscure world called “Earth”. It’s like *The Expanse* (~~except not awful~~) meets *Gurren Lagann* (~~except not as good~~) - zany hard-ish sci-fi, built on a foundation of alternate history with paleofuture characteristics.



***Paladin*** is my repeatedly-botched attempt at a superhero alternate history that at this point is more re-writes and re-drafts than consistent canon. The POD for *Paladin* is January 1st 1945, when the first “metahumans” were born. Didn’t show up fast enough to change the course of WW2, but they change the course of the rest of the 20th century (and change parts of pre-1945 history, due to reality-warping metahumans subconsciously and retroactively altering the fabric of reality). Fast forward to 2020, the world has only just recovered from World War 3 in the 1980s - no nukes, just supervillains, demons, aliens, the undead, killer robots, giant monsters and evil wizards. America in 2020 is no longer a superpower, and has a post-post-apocalyptic “cassette futurism” vibe. The President since 2004 has been a talking gorilla named Stig Englebert. The graffiti-tagged husks of old tanks rust along the highways, with the bleached skeletons of giant monsters further afield. The Great Plains are full of extraterrestrial lifeforms who also happen to be conservative Christians. There’s an active volcano in Hell, Michigan. Most of Nevada is the fiefdom of man-child supergeniuses who wage endless wars for fun against each other due to an obscure legal loophole. Chicago is a total mess with a miles-wide eyeball floating above it, and is run by an evil wizard, all with the full permission of the US government. The Statue of Liberty is in Times Square, after a supervillain ripped it off Liberty Island *for the second time*. Other cities are still in ruins - some used to be home to hundreds of thousands, but now they’re abandoned, often home to squatting supervillains. Other cities are vanished completely, gone forever. New cities have since been built to replace them, especially in what’s left of California, which was torn to pieces during the war; the Central Valley is a horrible flooded swamp where thousands of Kaiju-Americans live, Bakersfield is entirely populated by friendly zombies, and the pseudo-futuristic metropolis of Millennium City, California rises above the mangled archipelago where Los Angeles used to be. Oh, and then there are all the metahumans - superheroes and supervillains and the ordinary people who just happen to have extraordinary abilities, but just want to live ordinary lives. This is a society where it’s normal for kids to go to special schools where they learn to fight crime, teenagers are allowed to risk their lives in such endeavors, and you can buy an M60 GPMG at your nearest Walmart (gun control becomes absurd when a portion of the population can breathe fire or hurl lightning bolts). There’s aliens, there’s magic, there’s robots. Bizarre happenings and outlandish violence are a fact of life, and everyone’s kinda jaded about it all. It’s just the sort of world that needs some real heroes.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

666,"&gt;Quran 9:73 - ""O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This verse is talking about the people who said they were Muslims and backstabbed them when it came down to defending themselves against the nonbelievers. It clearly mentions hypocrites in the same context as unbelievers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Quran 9:123 - ""O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the historical context, this verse was revealed in order to fight the enemy, Banu Qurayza, a Jewish tribe who lived in Medina. They allied with the pagan Arabs of Makkah in order to exterminate the Muslim community. In short, they were the aggressors.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Quran 17:16 - ""And when We wish to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter destruction.""

&amp;#x200B;

The verse speaks about the people in the past how they spread tyranny and corruption. When they were told to stop, they disobeyed and their sins increased.

Some have used the above verse in claiming that Muslims are allowed to destroy cities. This is a wrong and twisted interpretation. The Prophet nor the Companions of Muhammed (p) interpreted it as such.

Furthermore, this verse was revealed when the Prophet was situated in Makkah. At that point in time, there were no such verses that commanded to fight anything, so this verse is talking about how Allah will do it himself.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Quran 25:52 - ""Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness with it.""

&amp;#x200B;

Again this verse was revealed when the Prophet was in Makkah when the verses of war weren't revealed yet. In this context, the ""striving"" meant the believers to go out and bring people to Islam by preaching the message of the Quran.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Quran 47:3-4 - ""Those who disbelieve follow falsehood, while those who believe follow the truth from their Lord... So, when you meet (fighting Jihad in Allah's Cause), those who disbelieve smite at their necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives)... If it had been Allah's Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight), in order to test you, some with others. But those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost.""

&amp;#x200B;

If you have read the first verse of this chapter:

""Those who disbelieve and avert \[people\] from the way of God – He will waste their deeds.""

you will know that the verses you have mentioned are talking about those who are by force prevented from believing in Islam or when a person is persecuted and it is difficult for one to remain steadfast in his faith. Meaning, the person is persecuted, oppressed so much so that he/she will eventually leave his religion. The two verses you have mentioned are in response to those individuals preventing someone from performing their religion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Quran 61:4 - ""Surely Allah loves those who fight in His cause""

&amp;#x200B;

Fight in Allah's cause can mean many things. Giving to charity, performing a sermon, fighting opression. You using this verse to say that Islam promotes violence is like me saying that you cant buy an AR in California and you tell people that I said that it's impossible to buy a gun in America. You're putting words in my mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Quran 66:9 - ""O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. Hell will be their home, a hapless journey's end.""

&amp;#x200B;

Same explanation as 9:73. This verse is talking about the people who said they were Muslims and backstabbed them when it came down to defending themselves against the nonbelievers. It clearly mentions hypocrites in the same context as unbelievers.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
667,"To have my own equivalent of the flexing on the pores mentality: most of the considerations you just said are four plebs who have to buy their ammo instead of making exactly what they want....

But of course feel free to roll your eyes at that sort of elitism too. I realize anything you do is a compromise.
I said all my guns to be reliable with subs without a can I will probably adjust them all when I have cans, but I'd rather a little bit more violence of action then to not be automatically reliable. I shoot subs and supers about equally. They are both fun for different reasons. 

Subs have a very nice smooth recoil impulse and they are safe on steel up close. Considerably closer than you really can with what I guess you could call rifle powered rounds. 

To me the 300 black pistol or carbine is sort of two guns that are very different guns for very different rolls with a simple magazine change. 

One gun is an extremely smooth and optimized submachine gun with very low recoil impulse and very little noise and great penetration including against body armor. The other gun is basically an AK but in an AR platform. So an acceptable but not amazing carbine. 

in the submachine gun roll if you are picky about your ammo whether using supers or subs it is an exceptional performer as a home defense gun out of short barrels that are handy. if it is in a pistol configuration gun then it travels with you loaded and just about every state could be loaded in your backpack loaded in your car loaded it your nightstand. A good performing expanding subsonic bullet designed for the caliber is ballistically equivalent to an exceptional 357 Magnum. so when people talk about it leaving a lot of performance on the table that is true relative to a rifle but it is still well more than enough for the job of a bump in the night gun.

for me both of those are magnified by the fact that it is really really economical to reload especially using cast bullets for both subs and supers. I have a huge pile of ammo that I just wouldn't have any other way. I shoot more often and in more different styles than I would otherwise. I don't exactly have infinite ammo but it's almost like that. 

Were it not for that aspect of my lifestyle this would be kind of a silly caliber to own for me.

As kind of talked around above I don't have a can yet but I will. I'd like to get something similar to the micro MOA adjustable gas block on each of my guns when I do that. That will make it convenient to tune them right at the level that is still smooth but has very functional reliability with a can and then reliable without it for the other main setting. 

Some people talk about this caliber like it is very difficult to get good performance out of but I just haven't found that It hasn't been too hard to get almost any build that I've done to be at least as accurate as an issue weapon and reliable with whatever commercial or homemade ammo I shove in it. Any gun you pick somebody will be able to name another gun another caliber or another specific load that is better for any particular application you choose. That game gets old sooner or later and you eventually just want a gun to shoot a lot. That's 300 blackout for me. it's my universal dude just about everything gun and universal just about do everything caliber. I have other guns for niche rolls but it is just a handy firearm and kind of the way that a lever action 30 30 or 357 was the handy do everything gun for a lot of America 50 years ago. 

My gear is very plebeian but it does everything I want to do and it doesn't reliably and easily and it's nice just to have things work.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
668,"If I copypaste it here so it's not in a scary gun sub, will you read it then?  Or are you just afraid it might make sense?

&gt; Like a lot of things, gun control is a very polarizing issue.  Most people are either *really* in favor of limiting/removing access to firearms, or *really* against it.  These strong feelings cloud the real issues.  We should not even be asking if we *should* ban guns, because everybody already has a strong opinion on that question and there's not really much room for a debate.  The question we need to ask - the question that makes the hot-button question irrelevant - is ""*can* we ban guns?""
&gt;
And the answer, in the United States, is no.
&gt;
I don't mean legally or morally, I mean that *logistically* we cannot possibly ban guns in any effective way.  It is simply impossible to disarm America at this point in time or at any point in the foreseeable future.  Any attempt to do so will, at best, be a major inconvenience to law-abiding citizens.  At worst, it will cause more violence and death than all the mass shooting attacks in recorded history.  What it *won't* do is make anybody any safer.  The gun genie is out of the bottle in the US, and there is no legislating around that fact.
&gt;
There are, at best guess, about a *quarter of a billion* guns in the USA.  That's nearly one gun per person.  Just about half of all adult Americans own at least one firearm.  Almost none of these weapons are ""registered"" in any meaningful way.  Even if the government threw the constitution and tradition to the wind (wouldn't be the first time) and enacted severe UK-style gun restrictions, there would be no way to find and recover those couple-hundred-million newly illegal firearms.
&gt;
Oh sure, you could ask people to hand them in.  You could even pay them to do so or threaten prison if they didn't.  But how many guns would that actually remove from circulation?  90% is probably a high estimate, but that still leaves tens of millions of guns out there.  There are more than a few people who have gun collections worth many thousands of dollars.  Do you think they're going to just give up their investment?  What about the sizable percentage of gun owners who deeply believe that gun ownership is their *right*, regardless of what ""the man"" says?  There are states that are seriously considering seceding from the union over *health care* - what do you expect to happen when the government that they already distrust tries to forcibly disarm them?
&gt;
Even if by some miracle you managed to remove 99% of all civilian-owned guns in the US without violence, then what?  That still leaves *several million* guns out there.  Guns which are, by definition, exclusively in the hands of people with no regard for the law.  All the people who would be most likely to use a gun to commit a crime *will still have their guns*.  Nearly all of those people aren't allowed to possess firearms now, what do you think will change then?  At best, crime will remain constant.  An argument could probably be made that it might even go up.
&gt;
OK, so obviously total disarmament is not feasible.  What about assault weapon bans?  We had one before, and though many grumbled, nobody started a civil war over it.
&gt;
Well, the fact is that it didn't actually *do* anything for gun crime rates.  Several studies showed no detectable change in crime trends thanks to the AWB.  Gun crime was already on the decline when the ban went into effect.  It continued to decline *at the same rate* during the ban, and maintained the same trajectory after the ban was lifted ten years later.  It created a hell of a hassle for gun owners, threw more than a few otherwise-law-abiding people in jail for technical infractions, and drove the cost of pre-ban guns and parts through the roof, but it didn't make anybody any safer.  There is nobody alive today who wouldn't have been if the ban had not been in place for a decade.
&gt;
So maybe this time it's a little stricter?  Maybe no grandfathering in pre-ban guns and parts?
&gt;
That just pushes you closer to the first option of violent resistance.  As I initially stated, any gun control measure in the US will, *at best*, do nothing.  There is no gun-crime reduction to be had that wouldn't come at the cost of massively larger anti-control violence.  There are too many guns in circulation, and too pervasive a gun culture in much of the country.  From a purely logical, rational standpoint, gun control as it is being pushed now is a *really* bad idea that cannot possibly benefit society.
&gt;
So the next time you engage someone on the other side in a debate (probably in the next five minutes, the way things are at the moment), try to refrain from emotional arguments and stick to facts and logic.  Yes, it is truly horrible what happened in CT last week and it probably wouldn't have been nearly as bad if he didn't have guns.  Yes, you like guns and you feel you are entitled to own them.  Yes, the other guy is always wrong.  But none of that matters.  **It is not possible to disarm American civilians.**  You can make guns every bit as illegal as drugs, and they'll remain just as accessible as drugs (to criminals, at least) for exactly the same reasons.  We don't even need to debate whether or not we *should*, because no matter what, we *can't*.  
&gt;
Instead, as we should be doing with drugs, we should be focusing on harm mitigation.  We cannot take guns away from everybody who might snap, but we can sure as hell reduce the chance that they might snap in the first place.  Health care in general and mental health care in particular is woefully underfunded and borderline inaccessible for much of the population.  You want to prevent atrocities?  Then help people before they get to the point where they feel that committing an atrocity is their only option.  *That* is something we *can* do.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
669,"Right...even the sentiment that Canada has it wrong. NO CANADA and New Zealand got it RIGHT. You do NOT need guns. We already have enough illegal gun violence and knife stabbing.

&gt;The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.
&gt;
&gt;Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.
&gt;
&gt;Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, ""By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?""

I do not need semi-automatics to hunt for food and certainly not to defend my home. 

I believe ppl should be able to buy what they want, but it's a responsibility to record wher weapons created for mass HUMAN causalities are located, what they are used for, and how they are secured.

Thing is we know it's impossible to take guns away from every person in America nonetheless locate stockpiles of guns stored far far from federal oversight.

I live in a state with loose gun laws I can drive down to the store right now and purchase a gun fill out one piece of paper and have a gun within minutes. I like that. 

And my state had no riots no looting, and no violence during 2021 despite the fact of many protests going on. Because everyone knows that if you get in a fight in the state you better be able to back it up with your life. 

We depend on each other to keep the peace. There is no way an American history they will forcibly remove weapons used for sustenance and on protection from people's houses. It's logistically impossible. if you've ever been to the true West there's literally no way anyone could ever accomplish this task. 

So please stop freaking out. Your guns are safe as long as you don't advertise you are planning to use them for mass casualty events on-line or have participated in threatening behavior in public. The internet is watching and there simply is no way to hide on social media.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mass shootings and mass murder are the absolute rarest forms of homicides. They account for less than 0.8% of homicides in the US and less than 0.004% of our annual deaths. On average they're so rare you are more likely to be killed by lightning in the US.

We also still see mass murder and even mass shootings in countries more strict gun control measures such as Norway, France, Germany, Spain, and others. So if these measures can't even stop the rarest forms of homicides they are clearly ineffective.

There is still plenty we can do without limiting  the rights and property of law abiding citizens. 

*""Gun violence""* is really a combination of multiple problems including suicide, mental health issues, drug addiction &amp; trade, and gang violence. 

Instead of focusing on the same tired ineffective gun policies focus on social policies, I suggest: 

* Comprehensive Mental Health Care reform with an emphasis on suicide prevention and increasing access and availability of support and counselling. 

* Create a nationally funded suicide hotline for immediate counseling and advertise it heavily through radio, TV, billboard, and internet ads. **Update: They did it! Dial 988 if you need help!** 

* Create a CDC suicide prevention task force to have small groups of mental health professionals go around the country providing free counseling, mental health evaluations, and support. 

* Create education subsidies and grants for those pursuing careers in the mental health field that agree to spend a designated time after graduation working in rural communities. There are similar programs for medical doctors. 

* Launch a comprehensive CDC study of common psychological drugs to determine potential risks for violent behavior associated with their use. 

* Create a national program to temporarily surrender your firearms at any police station for 72 hours. 

* Implement a national counseling app produced by the US Department of Education, for students K through 12 as well as College, that provides counseling resources including face to face tele-counseling to provide nationwide counseling resources for all students. 

* Federal Tax credits for gun safes and annual gun safety courses. 

* Real gun safety education elective courses in high school, like drivers ed. 

* Legalize and regulate marijuana in America in the style of alcohol. Apply a 20% tax rate with all tax revenues ear marked for education in the zip code collected. 

* Create a national work program focused on rebuilding the crumbling infrastructure in America with a recruiting campaign targeting low income high crime areas. Not unlike the Civilian Conservation Corp. 

* Federally mandate all uniformed peace officers and agents to have an active body cam during working hours. 

* Create a federal FBI task force to independently investigate all police shootings and determine their validity. 

* Disband the ATF and give their duties to the FBI with increased funding. 

* Enact and enforce mandatory minimums, 10 year per gun and 1 year per bullet, for all prohibited persons found guilty of committing a property or violent crime with an illegally possessed firearms unless they cooperate with investigators to identify and testify against who supplied them the illegal guns and ammunition to help end straw purchases. 

* Create a multi agency task force to target know gang members for tax evasion through the IRS. How they got Capone.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

675,"Two ways

1. It's origins were explicitly racist, with racist intent, which carries through to our time. Modern firearms policy was first enacted when freed slaves attempted to arm themselves to protect against non-state-sanctioned violence from locals. Later, during the 60's black rights movement, we got the first chunks of modern racist gun control after POC began arming up to protect themselves at the polls. The NRA helped write that first round, too. 

2. Anything monetary in nature impacts low income folks more than others. Speeding tickets are the classic example. Why do rich people drive like shit in fancy cars, get DUI, get accidents? It literally doesn't matter how much the car costs, the high risk insurance, the DUI lawyer. They can throw money at it. Since it's a well documented fact that in America POC experience a strong wealth gap and income inequity, you can say that there is a racial component to the fiscal side of gun control. Putting that silencer behind a tax stamp is not just a speedbump to deter the masses, but it doubly affects low income people, and thus, minorities.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
676,sounds like what we need though with all the gun violence in America,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
677,"I don’t think the person you replied to said anything about guns so I’ll assume that was meant for me.

We do have a gun problem. Even if you don’t account for suicides, more people die in America per 100,000 people by gun violence than in the vast majority of 1st world countries. 

I’m a competitive shooter, and a long range shooter. I’m educated on firearms. I know that 70% of non suicide gun violence is gang related and illegally acquired firearms and thus gun control won’t really work. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a problem. Gang violence with guns is still gun violence, and why we need to crack down on the gangs to reduce gun violence, without cracking down on the constitution.

I said I consider myself left *leaning*, not *leftist*. I fully support the constitution unlike many hardcore leftists. But gang violence with guns is still gun violence. I just believe there’s solutions outside of further infringing on the constitution, involving cracking down on gangs. But I’m not an expert on gangs so I don’t claim to know exactly how to do that, but it’s definitely a problem that needs fixed. Thousands of people every year die of gang violence, guns or no guns. Murder is murder and that’s unacceptable.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
678,"Escalating terrorism? There's the issue. You categorize right-wing protests - which are literally 99.99999% peaceful - as terrorism, yet BLM burning ENTIRE CITIES is A-OK. Are there far right wing nutjobs yes, but you act like all the destruction caused by BLM is fine. Those articles are a joke, pure propaganda. Shit, the moment you quote CNN you lost all credibility. I'm talking about the vast majority of Trump supporters who wanted nothing to do with the Capitol bullshit, and even then, good luck finding even half the violence of a typical, big-city BLM rally. Use DC as a reference. Compare last July to January. No contest in terms of destruction and bodily harm. BLM rallies are more violent than any Trump rally, and to argue otherwise is retarded. Even the ""peaceful"" BLM rallies are full of violent rhetoric, chanting to kill all cops, kill white people, and other crap. 

I love how you take any white murderer and classify him as a Trump supporter, so all Trump supporters are terrorists? Fuck you. I guess all Muslims are terrorists too then, right? Trump supporters cross racial boundaries, we treat others as equals. Any wacko fuck who would go after another race, like the elPaso shooter, isn't a Trump supporter. Even your own article has nothing to do with Trump. Just because he liked the wall for his own reasons doesn't mean anything. Either way, you liberal cultists have been taking shits on conservatives for 5 straight years, openly wishing DEATH on us, and you wonder why a few start to snap? You do know David Duke is a Biden supporter, right? Congrats on that. Nice to know all liberals are KKK supporters (your logic). 

Speaking of Biden, of course there's no pro-Biden anarchists. There's no pro-Biden ANYTHING, which is amazing, considering he's the ""most popular President in history"". Quid Pro Joe is bought and owned by the CCP, so of course Reddit loves him, I suppose. How you can't fathom his corruption, displayed for all to see, is beyond me or any other same individual. You called Trump a fascist, he never did anything remotely fascistic or authoritarian. Fascists don't broker historic peace deals in the Middle East. Biden? 50+ executive orders in his first two weeks. The destruction of 100000 jobs and immediate raising of gas prices, just to virtue signal. Who's the authoritarian ruling by EO now? Of course, WE know that it's not Biden. He's a puppet. He's a good boy doing what he's told. He has no idea what he's signing. 

Charlottesville? Really? Going down the debunked very fine people hoax? Okay then, I'll throw Ferguson in your face. Obama immediately threw the police under the bus, inciting violence, not knowing the facts. That whole Hands Up Don't Shoot BS never happened. A thug robbed a store, then attacked a cop trying to take his gun and got shot. Boohoo. Don't care about his race, if a white guy does the same, put him down just the same. For every George Floyd, we've got a Tony Timpa. Not every damn thing is racial. Sometimes cops ARE bastards. Sometimes thugs, of any race, deserve what they get for violently resisting arrest. Sometimes the cops are clearly at fault. 

Regardless, none of this is Trump's fault. Just because Trump supports law and order, doesn't mean he supports corrupt police either. 

It's been going on since way before Trump. Trump hasn't changed since he was younger, I've seen the interviews. Back then, he was LOVED by Hollywood and Democrats alike. His only transgression was daring to take on the establishment, against Queen Hillary and King Obama. He dared to oppose the corrupt press. That's what Trump supporters love. He fought for America, even for those of oppressed communities, despite the hatred thrown at him every day. Yeah, he was crass, but he spoke truth to power, and got in their faces, and called out their hypocrisy. WE all know he's a blowhard, but we also understand his narcissism. Trump was a chance to get things done for the people, but Dems and RINOs of the ""establishment"" elite wouldn't have it. Even DACA, remember them? He tasked the legislative branch to come up with a solution. What did they do instead? Wasted taxpayer dollars on a sham Russia hoax. That's okay, instead of a booming economy for all, you now have a near dystopian state of lockdowns, rising prices and oppression of all except the rich and powerful corporations that truly run things.

679,"Yeah it’s almost like the definition of a defensive gun use is “used a gun defensively”. Who woulda guessed that left a broad interpretation of defensive firearm uses? 

As someone who was suicidal, owning a gun did not change my decisions. I didn’t even think about using my guns to kill myself, even if after my attempt I surrendered my guns to a family member until I was in a better headspace. 

The ability to defend myself is my choice to make, not the government who has proven they’ll choose the side of domestic terrorists over her own citizens. I’ll fight to keep that *right* available to America and all of her people. 

It’s not irrelevant to being japan up, it further reinforces the point that socioeconomic policies like Universal Healthcare would have a much larger and more positive effect than any gun control could even DREAM of having.

683,"I do agree that the fear surrounding semiautomatic rifles is ignorant but the unfortunate reality is that too many people committed too many mass murders with assault rifles and it’s scared the uninformed majority. But where do we go from there? Clearly there’s an issue involving firearms and violence in this country. I don’t agree with it but I don’t blame them for thinking that the solution is to ban the most well known weapons that are designed to kill humans efficiently. Have you ever had a conversation about guns with someone that’s lived there entire life in a city with no firearm experience? They just don’t get it. Of course that’s there reaction. I don’t think that their views will change unless there are more strict requirements for who can own them that helps to exclude the violent minority. 
What I was getting at though is that many people seem to think that a semiautomatic ban is the first domino to fall in banning all firearms and I just don’t think that’s true. There are SO MANY GUNS in America already. There are hundreds of thousands of people with guns that aren’t registered. Half of America holds their right to bear arms up as one of the fundamental freedoms in our country. I don’t see it happening.

Neither nation experienced drops in mass shootings or other gun related-crime that could be attributed to their buybacks and bans.

691,"No I never said any of the stuff that you said. BLM is a corrupt Marxist organization. They admit to being trained marxists. They have raised billions of dollars and put almost none of it back into black communities.

As for the systemic racism there is absolutely no systemic racism. Everybody in America regardless of their circumstances has the same opportunities. If you want to talk about systemic racism you can talk about affirmative action where you get a job or a promotion based on the color of your skin and not the merit of your work.

Police violence is certainly not a rampant issue in the United States. Out of 330 million people in our country there are less than 100 people a year gun down by police officers. If you want to get technical, white people are at a higher risk of being shot by police officers. White people are shot more than black people but have significantly less contact with police. It doesn't matter percentage of population in this statistic it matters the amount of police contact.so with that being said 330 million people in the country and less than 100 or 150 people are gunned down by police officers unjustly a year not saying it's not a problem but it's not a huge problem like you make it out to be.

Another thing I don't care for black lives matter is because they only care about black lives when it's convenient for them. They don't care about black people when it's black on black crime that's totally okay even though that is much more of a problem than police shootings. Before you say that that is systemic racism at work I'm going to tell you right now it's not. Single-family households contribute quite a bit to the statistics. Instead of people going out getting pregnant by some guy who does not care about them and in turn he abandons them they should take a at the decisions they're making that may affect the future of their child. 

Just because I don't agree with black lives matter doesn't mean I don't agree that there needs to be some more training for police officers. That also doesn't mean that I hate black people or wish ill will on black people. So, like I said stop putting words in my mouth.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assuming it takes an arsenal of weapons to do damage is just false, and in America if you haven’t noticed there is an extreme issue with gun violence and supremacism.

Even beyond that, SO MUCH of what you say is “I experienced” or talking on your own experience &amp; “people I’ve talked with” and that’s COMPLETELY anecdotal! In no way is anecdotal experience EVER a good starting point for a HUGE generalization, as in this case with porn habits and greater issues of abuse and how people view women. If ANYTHING, we’ve gotta a ton BETTER over the years because things like spousal rape are actually illegal, because now even though kink is huge, teaching consent is ACTUALLY a thing that was NOT pushed as big 10 years ago. You can’t look at the landscape of men you’ve talked with, then look at how streamlined porn has become, and magically make a correlation between them. There are tons of other factors, this is just too many biases and fallacies to be a legitimate argument at all.

Hardly violence, just some people being hysterical. wHy frame such a thing as a ""violent attack""? good for anyone who takes their issues straight to their house of representation - though it's also an issue of the senate, which is essentially the english house of lords with the same role and powers and function.

of course originally the upper house wasn't elected as the founding fathers said they wanted to preserve the upper house from the ""fury of democracy"", which is why washington d.c is so beautifully laid out to gun down rampaging mobs from strong points. iirc the senate only became directly elected sometime around first world war, 1915? 1918? but they're still nobility; they're still the house of lords; they still act in a quasi noble status of two per state of a sort of duke of minnesota and earl of oregon and have effectively life tenures and share their loot with followers.

the founding fathers didn't care for ""democracy"" but cared for ""liberty"", at least in the sense of the liberty of capital, which liberal capitalism drags *equality before the law* as its ball and chain; all men born equal, *men* being the men *of your group* who are *white* (preferably anglo saxon and not those swarthy swedes, as franklin put it) *and of good character.* Somehow people misinterpret this as if the founding fathers thought all humans were actually equal and some ethnicties weren't far superior to others lmao americans are amazing on their own history, just a narnia of bullshit reading whatever they want into anything. a base of operations for anglo saxon racial conquest of the americas, not equality between all homo sapiens lmao.

To the founding fathers democracy and liberty were not synonymous but were hostile to one another, but then there was never any democracy to begin with. The lower house represents grievances, which largely evolved out of germanic traditions preserved in england. of course many european nations had parliaments hailing from the early middle ages with similar traditions but most didn't survive the middle ages, let alone gain relevance. The idea was that someone represents you and fights for you in that inherent combative nature of germanic law and politics and justice. the job of these representatives is to attack and be attacked, but none of these representatives are splintering shields with axes in the name of their little group back home, far from it they don't seem to be able to hear anyone except their lobbyists. people who were serfs wouldn't tolerate many aspects of what this system has devolved into - they couldn't vote but they got represented.

There's no connection to ancient greece. so what the fuck are these retards talking about when they talk about ""democracy being attacked""? what democracy? do they know the first thing about their stupid anglo saxon system they live in?

when *THE SIEGE OF THE CAPITOL* happened i pointed out in some places *remember the time black panthers went to a capitol building with guns?* but what a mistake as if the point is to show double standards, but revealing when people react as if that's also necessarily a bad thing.

these people talk about nazis, but many of the people who defeated the nazis would make neo nazis blush, including 90% of the american public who in 1943 polled as preferring to have germany win the world war - for hitler to rule the world, than ending racial segregation. then they'll claim they identify with these fervently white nationalist american gis in ww2 running around in normandy.

and they say the nazis are attacking the democracy, but their entire system continuing england - essentially most of americna history the americans saw themselves as *the true anglo-saxons* where america was the true continuation of england, descends from edward i's establishment of model parliament in 1295.

that came out of a civil war of pogroms of jews. the man who established the origin of that capitol building forced jews to wear yellow stars and had show trials and executions of jews and exiled them from england.

703,"Here are some quick statistics on gun violence in America:

In 2018, there were roughly 40,000 gun related deaths, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.0122% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those roughly 40,000 deaths:

• 24,000 (60%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)

• 1,000 (2.5%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 500 (1.25%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 40,000 annually, but rather roughly 13,500... 0.004% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location. According to a review of FBI homicide statistics (6), the 10 cities with the highest firearm homicide rates (Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, Louisville, Milwaukee, St.Louis, Baltimore, Birmingham, Memphis, and New Orleans) make up roughly 20% of those deaths.

This leaves 10,800 deaths for everywhere else in America... about 200 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 10,000 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)

You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)

Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 62% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14

Page 15:

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.

Older study, 1995:

Page 164

The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.

704,"&gt;Now, let's say we take some fascists that aren't nazis and aren't bigots. I think they might actually believe what Quirrell believes. Of course, I haven't met one, so take my judgement with a grain of salt (personally not for big government).

I don't know if you can somehow separate Nazism and Fascism from bigotry. Racism is an integral part of those ideologies. ""Unity"" is hardly an exclusively fascist concept, after all; communists too will ask workers of the world to unite! That through unity there is greater strength to be found is just common sense. The question is always by which means should that unity be achieved, and how much can be sacrificed to it.

No war is won and no crisis is overcome by a disunited people, really. But sometimes people come together of their own, sometimes they need to be incentivized, lured, motivated, or outright compelled into it. Fascism isn't just about unity, it's about unity *built on certain, specific myths*: military strength, racial superiority, adoration of the past. All of these myths are fundamentally irrational and perniciously dangerous. Racial superiority is nonsense. Adoration of the past always leads to stasis and forces you to lie to yourself about history. And while military strength is certainly *a* type of strength, and undeniably a useful one, if you build your whole identity and sense of self worth as a nation around it, well... you know what they say problems start looking like when all you have is a hammer. It is really no coincidence that an alliance of three strongly militaristic, nationalistic regimes that saw war as the only worthy pursuit of humanity ended up starting the bloodiest war in human history. If all you crave is either glory or a heroic death in battle, someone is going to be on the other end of your gun.

Now, consider this scenario: a democratic country which values freedom, knowledge, the arts, the diversity of human culture. Citizens who are so proud of these values that, were they to be threatened by brute strength and tyranny, they would spontaneously raise up in arms to defend them, not because they love war, but because they love what they're trying to protect. Does that sound as awful and dangerous as fascism? Why, no, that's basically what the United States of America would *like* to be, and look like (what they are is quite a bit below that ideal, of course). But it's still unity. The point Quirrell was making was good because it was not a point about fascism, it was a point about citizens having civic consciousness, a sense of responsibility, trust into each other, in other words about a country being a society in the true sense of the word rather than a disorganized conglomerate of individuals each with their own selfish interests and no investment in the common good. What kind of ""story"" builds such a society, what keeps it together, what do its inhabitants believe in, is all that matters in determining what it looks like. Fascism's evil isn't trying to build a unified society, it's doing so with an evil story, and straight up coercion and violence where that doesn't work.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
705,"Mass Shootings.

Although gun violence is an issue in the United States, mass shootings are more rare that what the news/some gun control activists would lead you to believe (including the claim that ""more mass shootings than days in the year"", which is very very misleading). 

In reality, the chances of being killed in a mass shooting are very slim. You're more likely to be struck by lightning (approx 0.0002%) than to die in a mass shooting (approx 0.00001%).

The universally accepted definition of a mass shooting is 4 or more people that are killed in a public location, excluding gang related shootings, robberies that went awry, and domestic violence shootings that took place exclusively in a home. Using this data, there have been around 176 mass shootings in the United States.......since 1966.

708,"Thanks for the insight. 

As for America, most of us firearm owners do worship guns. (If you ever got to shoot some cool guns you’d love them too lol). 

I think what makes us most upset when talking about gun control, is that it’s been proven time and again that disarming the law abiding citizens does absolutely nothing to curb firearm related violence. 

It’s written into our constitution that we are to be allowed to keep and bear arms, and then it explicitly says that the right shall not be infringed. 

Any sort of firearm related legislation is just that, infringement. 

When you grow up in a rural area and you’re responsibly raised around firearms, you come to cherish them. Whether it’s for hunting or sport, or even for a worst case scenario type situation. 

When shady politicians try to create rules that would separate us from our legally owned firearms, we get upset (and we damn sure aren’t the only country that does). 

As stated before, criminals don’t pay any attention to firearm legislation. The only thing gun control serves to do is disarm law abiding citizens, and make the average man/woman that much easier of a target.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
709,"&gt; If a fascist coup is using violence to take over the government, your suggestion is to just let it happen?



We have the National Guard and the military to prevent that. There will never be a situation in modern America where the people prevent a coup. That's a fantasy. 


&gt; That there's no point in fighting, so we should just give up preemptively?

We already gave up when we spent decades ignoring the ever increasing military budget. Either the military participates in the coup, in which case it's over and your pea-shooters aren't stopping it no matter how much you stockpile, or the military doesn't participate, in which case the coup won't work regardless of whether or not the people are armed to the teeth.

&gt; Common sense would be to let people keep their ARs.


Common sense would be working to reduce the number of guns in circulation, restricting access to those who are responsible gun owners, and limiting guns that are unnecessary for self-defense. ARs in and of themselves aren't an issue imo, but the high capacity magazines are. No one needs 30 rounds in a magazine. No one needs that level of efficiency and effectiveness for practical self-defense or hunting purposes. All it does is give people planning significant damage a better chance to succeed at doing significant damage. Same reason we don't allow people to buy bombs and grenades.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like, why are a few parts of the human body fetishized like that, and if the lads in the band didn't see it that way.. then I guess in would be very on-brand to say ""fuck it"". It's a bit weird how America especially seems to have more issues with nudity than gun violence.. and if a few feet-fetishists get off on feet, so what? Do we all freak out at exposed feet?

712,"You clearly don’t understand American politics, culture or history and normally I’d say that’s fine because you aren’t American and I wouldn’t expect you to. Unfortunately, however, it’s somewhat trendy for foreigners to act like our system is crazy because they aren’t familiar with it.

There ARE reasons for civilians to own guns. The primary reason they are allowed is for self defense and insurance against a tyrannical government. Americans enshrined in the constitution the right to bear arms to serve as a constant reminder to our political servants that they serve the public which has the means to defend itself. Want to see an example of this in? Consider how the presence of weapons at both the BLM and capital riots forced the country to pay attention to both movements. 

My issue with your statement was that you use the allowance of gun ownership as proof of a defunct government. By definition, this can’t be the case in America because Guns have always been allowed. Clearly, we still exist and have existed since our conception as a nation so you can’t consider us defunct on that basis. You also snidely comment “laws the government can’t enforce it seems.” In order for the government to fail to enforce laws, those laws would have to exist. Since it is legal to own a gun, no laws are being failed to be enforced. In fact, every instance of gun violence in a European nation with strict gun laws would by your own definition be an example of a defunct government. 

“That law was made with muskets...” so have you ever considered that, with other aspects of the constitution, the founding fathers considered the possibility that weaponry would continue to advance? The wording is not “the right to bear arms that can fire once every eight seconds,” it’s the right to bear arms. The meaning of this line is that gun ownership is a balance against the government as a whole. It would be meaningless if the government had superior weapons than what citizens are allowed to bear. 

“Ignoring the facts,” which facts would that be? The *opinion* that the FF were referring to only muskets, which is objectively incorrect? The *incorrect* fact that the US is the only first word country which allows gun ownership? The *incorrect* fact that there is no reason for a citizen to own a weapon? I’m sure the Myanmar republic or any other oppressed populace would be in complete agreement with you.

You’re talking about beliefs and rights, I’m talking about reality and events that have actually occurred. You’re so concerned that your freedoms are somehow being impinged you’re unable to consider reality.  

I explicitly stated that I don’t think all guns should be banned, I suggested more effective procedures for gaining gun licenses. I’ve not said “I’m going to take away your guns”, I’ve said “everyone who meets stringent criteria should be allowed to have a licensed fire arm”. That’s not imposing beliefs, that’s using evidence and facts to support an effective system to help curtail excess gun violence. 

You’ve presented a false equivalence with the drugs/guns comparison. Not sure what your “prosecuted for hate speech” is referring to since similar laws exists in the US. Your rant about “freedoms” is particularly funny since the country myself and many others felt most restricted by was the US:

Your expensive healthcare and education systems mean people are burdened by huge amounts of debt; your police presence is far higher than in the UK creating an imposing presence in most places; social mobility is much lower; your drinking laws are insanely strict; your political parties mean you essentially have two choices, whereas the UK government is currently composed of 10 different parties; 40% of Americans have never left the country, 11% have never left their own state, compared to only 16% of people in the UK who have never been abroad. 

America isn’t a country of freedoms, you’re a country where people are promised a better future that never comes. You’re a country where people are so preoccupied with ideas of freedom and rights that you ignore hard facts and how controlled by the state you already are. 

It’s comical really. Multiple cities in the US are currently experiencing lockdowns and curfews, more military presence than Iraq &amp; Afghanistan combined, yet you still manage to claim you’re the place where freedom and free thought are strongest.

715,"Indisputable American gun violence evidence

Here are your sources and statistics.



The ACTUAL facts about gun violence in America:

There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:

• 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)

• 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 489 (2%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location:

298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)

327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)

328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)

764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)

That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.

This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)

You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)

Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.

716,"Vietcong, stopped the US military way outgunned. We broke from the British, way outgunned and outnumbered. 

I’ll make the argument and pray you consider it. 

You absolutely might need 15+ rounds in a shooting. Look at real house break ins and often times it’s 3+ home intruders. Some being as many as 6. Active self protection on YouTube goes through thousands of real life scenarios that show ammo capacity absolutely matters for self defense. 

The second amendment is absolutely a fail-safe against the government. It doesn’t matter if it’s AR’s AK’s or bolt action rifles. There are far too many guns, and too many gun owners for them to ever strip us of our guns. But what we can do is if we wanted arm every citizen in the US privately and yes absolutely a unified citizenry could overthrow the US government or at the very least splinter into a different country. There are estimated to be over 400 million guns in the US. Are they going to nuke the country/citizens they plan to rule over? If so seems like a quick way to lose even more support. 

My point in saying all of that, they won’t strip us of guns today or tomorrow. But they’ll strip them from your children, and grandchildren. They’ll convince fence sitters that “who needs an AR” well take those. And who needs a “high capacity magazine”, thank you very much. And “who needs semi automatic weapons”, you can hunt with a bolt action. And “hunting is bad for the environment we can have the government do population control, give us your bolt actions”. Even if they just stop new production or limit ammo they’re playing a slow game of choking out supply. 

Sure YOU can live on in a “free” America, and pride yourself on being the last generation with real access to firearms. I bet you people were making the same argument I am making when they banned automatic weapons, and Chinese weapon imports, and passed the NFA, or the assault weapons ban of 1994. 

Either you believe we have an inherent right to change the government meant to serve us (through peace or violence), or you are welcoming an oppressive government.

No, in fact I’d like rollbacks of most of what we already have. 

&gt;America has massive amount of gun violence compared to other countries with similar gun laws. 2) Do you have any thoughts on why?

No clue, but I’d assume demographics/culture. Gang culture is an issue in our country which needs to be addressed. The criminals are the big issue, not the tools used in the crimes. 

Also, I’m not a fan of the leftist tactic of separating gun crime from non gun crime. It’s disingenuous to me. They always bring up how the US has XXX% higher gun violence cases or firearm homicides than countries with strict gun control while ignoring overall crime rates as if a murder is somehow worse if carried out by a gun than by a hammer or something else. This isn’t a dig at you mind you, just something that I try to stay away from. 

&gt;P.S. I'm more liberal, but I love guns. I support 2A, but I feel their has to be some kind of ""common sense"" reform that can be done?

Trump's executive order banning bump stocks is partly fueling the panic buying, but far moreso is the incoming administration's very blatant anti-2A rhetoric. And to top it off for good measure we have the violence and unrest. Law abiding citizens on both ""sides"" are scared, frusturated and angry and with good reason. Particularly gun owners/lovers who tend to be more right wing (notice i said ""tend"") who watched cities literally burn and mob rule prevail all summer, only to be cheered on by the left and a very biased media, then ignorantly lumped together with a small band of violent idiots that stormed the capital and called ""un-American seditionists"" by the hypocrites who claim to want tolerance and equality yet are absolutely the most intolerant people on the planet. It really is the perfect storm.  
    All of this has fueled unprecedented demand for ANYTHING that goes ""pew pew"". The 3 major ammo manufacturers have backlogs of over a year just to fill existing orders. Couple that with no less than a dozen and a half anti-2A pieces of legislation pre-filed before the new regime is even in office and the fact that in any given year ammo consumption in America is between 8 - 10 billion rounds but is now estimated to be around 16 billion rounds it's to see that this shortage won't end anytime soon. The math on that alone means approximately 4 years to catch up with demand.  As far as manufacturing investments to ramp up production (nevermind the difficulties they are having getting raw materials),  Biden has promised 27 executive actions in his FIRST 10 DAYS and it's a safe bet that at minimum 1 or 2 will most assuredly be anti-2A making the prospect of putting more capital into a product with a very uncertain future is dubious at best.

721,"Right, did the UK's crime rates drop after they instituted said bans? 

The answer is no. The UK and other European nations have had low rates of violent crime for a long while, with or without guns. 

Look at Switzerland until relatively recently it was even easier to get a gun in Switzerland than in the US. You could even get a fully automatic one with little fuss. Do you think Switzerland was as crime prone as the US before 2007?

Semi automatic rifles/handguns have been the framework for every modern gun for the last 100 years. It isn't some startling new technology that is suddenly plaguing our cities.  

Violence has been dropping in all developed countries since the 80's including America. America actually had a faster rate of decline in their rates of violence than Australia during the period following their mandatory buyback. 

Guns aren't the problem. Gun ownership is actually a fairly bad indicator of violent crime. You know what the best indicator of crime and violent crime are? Inequality.

There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. U.S. population 324,059,091 as of in 2016.
?
This means that 0.0000925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is irrelevant!
?
Let's do a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:

• 65% of those deaths are suicides

• 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified

• 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons – gun violence

• 3% are accidental discharge deaths

?
So technically, ""Preventable gun violence"" is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100.
• 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago
• 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore
• 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit
• 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years for 2016)
?
25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of gun control that is the root cause of these murders. This basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher firearm homicide rates than others. For example, California had 1,169(!!) and Alabama had 1. California, of course, has strict gun control measures.
?
Now, are 5,100 deaths per year horrific?
Let me be clear, All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime.
?
Let's compare that to other forms of death.
• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–and this is rising year-over-year.
• 36,000 people die per year from the flu
• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities
ALSO:
• 200,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors.
You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!
?
• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. If the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in annual cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). Just a 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of overall gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Tell me what good banning rifles will do? Of the 10,982 gun murders or manslaughters in the US in 2017 only 4% of them were from rifles (this includes all rifles, not just ""assault rifles""). That is 439 deaths by rifle compared to a population of 330, 841,000 people. There are 2,839,000 yearly deaths in the US so there is a 0.000154% chance of dying by rifle of any type in the US or a 0.00179% chance of murdered by any gun, if you don't inclolve yourself in criminal activity like gang violence that number shrinks even more.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
725,"I live in a multi gun household lmao but go off.

Again I could care less that there are millions of “responsible” gun owners or that America is a “gun culture”. We were also a Slave Culture at our inception, old doesn’t mean it’s a good idea. We have tens of thousands of preventable deaths a year because guns are easily accessible in America. Theres a cohort of people who are angry and violent and will use guns to harm people and there’s no legal way to disarm them up until they commit violence. There’s also a large cohort of the mentally ill who will use firearms for suicide. No amount of promoting “responsible” ownership is going to do anything about that and the rest of the world laughs at us for being this stupid about guns. Again you gun people dance around this and lie about it constantly, which makes me trust pretty much none of you. 

Virtue signaling that you’re a vet does nothing for me here btw lol I don’t care, I don’t worship the military, and we haven’t been in a just war since WW2. Broadcasting that you were roped into the US military’s shenanigans doesn’t make me think you or your buddies are good decision makers",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
726,"Political action is useful and valid only if that action advances the cause you are attempting to advance. Right now America is in a sort of cold civil war and the extreme right wing have made great advances. 

One of several reasons for this is they understand this is a war to be won or lost through propaganda on TV and the internet. And unfortunately some on the left are more than willing to give them fodder for the propaganda mill by showing derisive contempt for whites and males, freaking out about ""micro-aggressions"" and ""cultural appropriation"" 

The right finds videos of student activists behaving badly and BINGO!! instant YouTube propaganda to radicalize young white males. Any acts of violence against the fascists in 2021 will only be used to show anyone left of fox news as being VIOLENT LEFTIST RADICAL MOBS so in the modern day, in the situation that we are in at this moment physical violence against fascists is not helpful.

I prefer going to forums that are not explicitly political but have a large primarily right wing contingent and just tossing out enough facts to break up the circle jerk/echo chamber, enough to sow doubt and encourage realistic thinking, being a gun owner since the seventies helps me with this but sometimes it is like trying to hold back the ocean tide with a teaspoon.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

728,"&gt;Trump was elected due to the ineffective politicians that repeatedly get elected and do nothing but blame the previous administration

To be fair trump has done a lot of just blaming the previous administration 

I do believe Joe got the most votes in history because our population is growing, iirc trump also got more votes than anyone besides Joe in history, people really cared about this election. 

I disagree that there is any evidence of meaningful voter fraud not much I can say on that.

I don't live in germany but I do know that here if you were here in sweden in 60s-80s things weren't like they are today. Just like my dad was able to get a job at 21 that allowed him to buy a new car and house without an education in Texas, swedes weren't in that great of shape back then. It's our progressive policies that have taxes the 1% both literally and figuratively by our extremely strong unions demanding living wages. It's why it's realistic for me in 2021 to buy a car and a house here like my dad did, and I see a huge freedom in the ability to make a meaningful life without being a rocket scientist. I think meaningful protest needs to make its way back to America in the form of unions. You do need violence to shut down an industry unless the police become strike busters again, at which point violence is fine, just never as a first resort. Peaceful protest&gt; striking &gt; violence when striking is met with violence. We don't have or need a minimum wage in sweden due to our unions. 

&gt;I agree the 2nd amendment isn’t about shooting people walking in your yard, but when the pizza delivery gets to your place faster than the police, being prepared isn’t a bad idea. And if you’re a fellow Texan, you know we don’t dial 911. Not Saying all criminals/thieves deserve the death penalty but laws are broken constantly and penalizing law abiding citizens who are firearms (you know where I’m going with this)

I totally agree, but I think our attitude towards violence in america needs to change. Living in texas where i shot 20 rattlesnakes a summer just in my garage I understand the need for guns as a tool before anything else 

Whioe I've never had a person in my garage I can guarantee I'd give it the same options i give a rattler, open the garage door and see if it'll move along on its own, then if it becomes aggressive dispatch it. The big difference is a rattle snake is always armed and I can't talk to It. I don't conceal but I used to carry in my truck, I never aimed or branished it but I can think of multiple times I could have and been well within my right.

That's the problem I see with this story and so many others, they are avoidable. I honestly think the vast majority of people who are so eager to defend themselves with life ending measures have no idea what it's like to watch another human being die in front of them, the lives I've seen lost and taken will forever replay in my head, I've never taken a life myself but at this point I've witnessed a fair amount and honestly I walk rather risk losing my own than to take someone else's unless there is absolutely no possibility of everyone walking away from the situation. 

The biggest thing is like to see is a more standardized, in depth class for all gun owners in drivers ed we have to watch ""the rules of the road are written in blood"" but we don't even attempt to give any guidance and education to gun owners. I'm not so stupid to think we can get rid of guns or that we need to ban ""assult"" weapons or high cap mags, bump stocks or whatever other nonsense people come up with, if I'm being honest I actually believe in a road to redemption for felons to regain their rights to own firearms. It's not fair to someone who was a drunk when he was a teenager to be barred from owning guns for the rest of his life, especially in places like alaska or texas where they are often used as tools.

I used to shoot competitive trap and skeet, but o have watched my generation become very dumb about guns as a milenial, these punisher AR15 builds and ""make my day"" dust covers you see everywhere reflect a lot about what the culture around guns is becoming. We need to bring respect back to guns first and foremost, I would love a world without guns, but we can't even manage to feed people much less build a society where we don't need them.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
729,"Chicago isn't a very good example. Yes, if you look at the data without variables, it appears to show that stronger gun laws don't work, but if you actually factor in the variables, the argument falls flat. State lines don't restrict travel with guns- and Indiana and Wisconsin practically grow guns on trees. Chicago hasn't ""banned"" guns. It had very tight restrictions which were then loosened again in 2010.

Anyways- tighter gun control laws aren't by any means the ONLY solution. They must be paired with accessible mental health, a removal of crippling medical debt, stronger education and child care infrastructures and better living wages to reduce gang activity and crimes of desperation. I posit that nationally accessible free healthcare is far higher priority than stricter gun ownership regulations.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The initial assembly of patriots will be at the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC, and will continue to build over the course of Saturday January 16, and, Sunday January 17, 2021. There should be a state flag, and American flag, present for each state so patriots can gather with other patriots from their home states. If multiple flags are displayed for a state, each group should walk towards each other to become one group for that state. We will gather for 2 hours each day starting at 12:00 noon so that numbers can be assessed. If at 2:00 on Sunday 1/17 it is becomes obvious that the will to fight for America against democrat tyranny is not strong enough for the turnout to be effective, the PAFA2021 will be declared a lost cause and Joseph Biden will be allowed to be inaugurated. The estimated number of armed patriots needed for the PAFA2021 to move forward is approximately 15,000. This number would allow a force of 4,000 patriots per location in Washington, D.C., and establish road blocks at set locations to assist in maintaining order at the lock down points. At these roadblocks, patriot forces will also assist law enforcement in subduing any violence that may arise as a result of the PAFA2021. It needs to be reiterated that if at ANY point during the PAFA2021, patriot forces encounter physical attack or gun fire, that event will be classified as an initiation of war against America and will officially change the classification of the PAFA2021 to civil war. NO ONE JOB OR LOCATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANOTHER DURING THIS ACTION.

&gt;  
&gt;With a force of 4000 per location, we will encircle the grounds of each of the three facilities designated on this page. The main purpose of surrounding the White House is to secure the grounds itself, along with President Trump, not allowing ANYONE in or out of the grounds unless designated permissible by the President himself on a one by one basis. Encircling the Capitol building will ensure that no democrat politicians gain access any longer for legislation to be discussed with them. Republican representatives and senators will be allowed access to discuss legislation and continue business as usual without democrat interference. At each facility, the ONLY entrance and exit open will be the main doors in the front of the buildings. All other doors and entrances will be blocked with absolutely NO ONE going in or out through those doors.  
&gt;  
&gt;All patriot participants will be responsible for finding their own food and lodging.  
&gt;  
&gt;Final details and execution methods have been established and will be revealed the afternoon of January 17th if the force is sufficient to move forward.

This statement just reeks of bias, also you haven't explained how requiring a registry treats people like criminals.

&gt;If I can say things anonymously on the internet like I am doing right now then I should be able to own guns anonymously as well.

You can say thing anonymously until you're enticing violence or luring a child, or commiting another crime, then your anonymity is void. Same thing goes for gun ownership, if you are irresponsible and in turn allow your firearm to wind up in a criminals hands then your ""right to anonymity"" is null and void. Also, no where in the 2A does it state you have a right to anonymity, you have the right to bare arms, which in some states still only means the right to bare on your own private property, not in public. In some states it's still a privilege you have to earn to carry in public. As it should be.

&gt;And what happens when the government goes and decides it doesn’t want to register any more weapons of a certain type?

Now you're moving the goalposts and strawmaning. Restricting firearm sales and types isn't what were talking about here, were just talking about registering at the point of sale/ownership. 

&gt;I don’t trust the government with that knowledge because the government is not always in the right

You're not trusting the government, you're trusting the public/your society as a whole. Also, why is it YOU are allowed to not trust your government, but the public around you HAS TO trust YOU without any say or choice?

The public could easily turn it around and say they don't trust YOU with 35 semi automatic rifles in your shed with a $4 padlock on it.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The UK is far from perfect, but I'm 35 and never seen a gun in my life and I know 99% of people don't carry. Even our police don't carry guns.

China had a meat clever wielding man. Evil comes in all shapes, if they want to kill. They will. That's why mental health should be key. I cannot stress this enough. Nikolas is dangerous, we ought to use him as an example. That's my opinion. He had plans for more killing. He's inhuman and has no true motivation for life, except for his obvious fear of death.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Never ever ever trust the cops. Don't call them, I can't even count the amount of times they have fucked over ppl I know personally.

The worst 3 are:

My brother, who the profiled, busted him with a few grams of weed at 15, they smashed up our cabin (found mint leaf tea and were too stupid to smell mint and sent it to a lab), harassed and hounded him for a decade.

My dead friend; 18 and slept with a 17 yo he went to HS with. They threatened to out him in papers as a rapist for the rest of his life.  He killed himself rather than face that.

My wife's brother; his mom had just died, he was young, like 15,  and it fucked him up hard. He was having a clear mental break and the family had called the cops to get him into a 72 hour hold. Instead of doing that, the charged him with a bunch of bullshit crimes (he had a knife and was threatening self harm). 15 years later they still harass him and have manufactured a criminal.

Don't ever, not for one second, think that they exist to help you. You take care of you and hope that if any sort of violence happens that you are lucky enough to get a good lawyer and let the piss poor legal system resolve it.

I have my concealed carry license. I carry everywhere. I've never once even been tempted to pull my gun. I'd rather talk or punch my way out of something, but like any tool, id rather have it and never need to use it than to be in dire straits and not have it.

744,"Disingenuous and bad faith arguing is minimizing the astronomical number of gunfire deaths the US experiences.
Defensive gun use is the Battle Cry of every gun owner in America

66 percent of all US gun violence death is suicide. 33 percent is unjustified homicide. 1 percent is justified homicide, legal intervention, accidents and unknown causes. In other words, defensive gun uses are rare.

The NRA has staked its entire agenda on the claim that guns are necessary for self-defense, but this gun industry propaganda has no basis in fact,” states VPC Executive Director Josh Sugarmann. “Guns are far more likely to be used in a homicide than in a justifiable homicide by a private citizen. In fact, a gun is far more likely to be stolen than used in self-defense.”

In addition, only a tiny fraction of the intended victims of violent crime or property crime employ guns for self-defense. Over a five-year period, less than one percent of victims of attempted or completed violent crimes used a firearm, and only a tenth of one percent of victims of attempted or completed property crimes used a firearm.

The study analyzes data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program’s Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR) and cites survey data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gun murder rate the US experiences is 20 times the average of 32 peer nations with tighter gun restrictions.
What about the insatiable appetite for illegal drugs in the United States by Middle America? Let's remember that there's always sellers when there is a market when money is involved. What about you focus on your own country's issues before throwing shade at other countries?

Thanks for agreeing that the astronomical number of gunfire-related deaths the US experiences is correlated with the number of guns in civilian hands. Which is reflected as expressed by having more gun dealers than the number of Starbucks and McDonald's combined.

Do you understand what US gun violence is composed of? The cdc reports that 66 percent of all US gun violence death is suicide. 33 percent is unjustified homicide. 1 percent is justified homicide, legal intervention, accidents and unknown causes. In other words, defensive gun uses are rare. Guns are used more often in aggressive behaviors than defensive behaviors thereby wiping out any protective benefit. You're more likely to be injured by your own gun before taking protective action.

The fbi reports that 67 percent of all US murders are by gunfire and not other tools such as hammers.

Besides, nobody uses hammers to butcher school children like pigs. You're thinking of law abiding American citizens who have legally accessed their weapons from retail gun stores.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s gonna change until we treat poverty, drugs and guns like other rich, first-world countries do.

And if we argue that “the constitution doesn’t matter when there is a national emergency and health and safety is more important” then what is to prevent a super far right/left administration and Congress to declare an “emergency” and infringe on rights? 

What’s to prevent a far left admin from declaring a “gun violence emergency”  and prevent the right to bear arms?

The majority of this violence is attributed to people using guns. 

This past year exposed the only remaining defense for the Second Amendment, which is the guns are supposedly to overthrow tyrannical governments. What happened? Nothing.

756,"You mean the dude who was shot because he answered the door with a gun?

The dude still shouldn't have been shot, he was well within his right to have it and immediately tossed it to the side and was in the process of dropping to his knees in immediate submission when he realized it was cops at the door, before he was shot point blank but the reason those cops freaked out was because of the gun, and the lying neighbor who claimed it was a domestic disturbance ""if it will get them [cops] out here quicker"" put them in a ramped up state of adrenaline to begin with.

It was because cops, in addition to some having bigoted issues, are rather incompetent at thinking their actions through and trained to immediately meet situations with violence.

It's how an autistic white teen, like age 14-15, got slammed to the ground and had his arm broken, because he was unable to produce a drivers license the cop was demanding, after being assumed to be on drugs for having fidgety fingers while taking a walk in the park, and the cop also refused to believe the mother of the teen who kept trying to tell him that he was too young and didn't have an ID yet, and was autistic. 5he cop refused to believe her in the slightest and remained on him for the next 15-20 minutes it took for backup to arrive.

 The mother was a big fan of police too, even wanted to give the cop a chance to publicly apologize to her child for his violent actions to avoid her suing him for the pain, suffering, and medical bills the cop needlessly inflicted on her child. She tried to give the cop a chance to redeem himself. The cop refused to even respond. And so she is now following through with her word and suing him for medical and pain and suffering in a civil suit. 

The teen boy, who she had always taught to trust police if he was ever scared or lost or in danger is now absolutely terrified of anybody in a police uniform and freaks out at the sight of them. The police union and department claimed that the officer did absolutely nothing wrong and did the right thing to act in such a way. 

Poor man in a dinky apartment doesn't matter to cops, and a neuro-divergent mentally disabled teenager doesn't matter to cops. The poor and the handicapped. Also not pictured are LGBTQ+ (especially trans folk), and any other skin color not white in my examples, but I think you get the gist by now. In America, if you're rich and white and straight and cis and neuro-typical and christian, you get plenty of protection and a light hand even when you fuck up hard (like go on a murder spree and get free Burger King the cops drive you to get, for an example). But if they ever see you don't fit all those categories, even just one of them being different, your chances of unjust treatment start to go way up.

Cops have many differently bigoted people amongst their ranks and in their higher ups, usually overlapping bigotries but not always. Some are just monsters to any and all because they simply enjoy inflicting pain on others, regardless of anything else. The FBI have been warning us for years now about such supremacists infiltrating ranks. And all those people love to exert their control over those they deem ""lesser"" to cause whatever degree of suffering they deem fits. And their cop buds and bosses will look the other way and pretend nothing bad happened at all.

Bigotries were at play, yes. But don't pretend it was because he was white when there are other, more obvious bigotries at play here. This ain't it chief.

Where do you think the ""bad people"" get the guns? They either:

- legally purchase them to use for an illegal purpose

- have somebody who can legally purchase them make a straw purchase for them

- steal them from somebody who legally purchased them

- purchase them under the table from shady licensed dealers who want to make an extra buck

- purchase them from an unlicensed street dealer who likely acquired them via one of the aforementioned methods

The source for the vast, vast majority of guns used in crimes in America originated with a legal purchase. If you take away the source, it becomes *much* more difficult for people to acquire firearms for criminal activities--this is pretty evident when you look at the relationship between gun ownership and gun violence in other countries.

Average Goodreads rating: 4.25/5

Summary:
&gt;__A powerful, poetic memoir about what it means to exist as an indigenous woman in America, told in snapshots of the author’s encounters with gun violence.__  

&gt;Toni Jensen grew up around guns: As a girl, she learned to shoot birds in rural Iowa with her father, a card-carrying member of the NRA. As an adult, she’s had guns waved in her face near Standing Rock, and felt their silent threat on the concealed-carry campus where she teaches. And she has always known that in this she is not alone. As a Métis woman, she is no stranger to the violence enacted on the bodies of indigenous women, on indigenous land, and the ways it is hidden, ignored, forgotten.  

&gt;In _Carry,_ Jensen maps her personal experience onto the historical, exploring how history is lived in the body and redefining the language we use to speak about violence in America. In the title chapter, Jensen connects the trauma of school shootings with her own experiences of racism and sexual assault on college campuses. ""The Worry Line"" explores the gun and gang violence in her neighborhood the year her daughter was born. ""At the Workshop"" focuses on her graduate school years, during which a workshop classmate repeatedly killed off thinly veiled versions of her in his stories. In ""Women in the Fracklands"", Jensen takes the listener inside Standing Rock during the Dakota Access Pipeline protests and bears witness to the peril faced by women in regions overcome by the fracking boom.  

&gt;In prose at once forensic and deeply emotional, Toni Jensen shows herself to be a brave new voice and a fearless witness to her own difficult history - as well as to the violent cultural landscape in which she finds her coordinates. With each chapter, Carry reminds us that surviving in one’s country is not the same as surviving one’s country.

766,"&gt;Earned confidence comes from one’s competence in whatever area. 

Certainly, I would agree with that.

&gt;Competence comes overcoming adversity, be it improving or developing skills or social or emotional hurdles.  

Yeah, I would agree with that too.

&gt;Unearned confidence can stem from the lack of, or disregard of  self-awareness. People who have never had their ideals, skills, ability,  etc. questioned can see having no adversity as having overcome  adversity.  

Perhaps, but what I've found in my line of work is that everyone has their own baggage. I've yet to meet a single person that hasn't had to overcome some very difficult obstacles.

&gt;Speaking for American culture, what group of people have it easiest in  terms of structural adversity? the people that the system is built for  and by, which is white men. 

Okay, I see what you mean. But America is just one nation. There's quite a lot of other nations around the place with different circumstances. Globally, Europeans have had a disproportionate amount of power and influence for hundreds of years, and hailing from pastoral cultures, they've had some pretty rigid patriarchies. But I think you're missing a very important point, because even among white men there are huge differences. There are the haves and the have nots. Sure, you're statistically less likely in the US to be harassed by police or have to go through extra hurdles when applying for a job or whatever, which is an advantage a lot of these white men you speak of might not realize they have. But you were making a broad strokes point about white men having an un-earned confidence. I think you're making a similar mistake to what you decry yourself. You're having confidence in something you don't know, not being a white man, not having grown up like this to see what it can be like. Just like I don't know what it's like to be black, asian, hispanic or whatever, nor do I know what it's like to be a woman. But I know what it is to overcome difficult challenges.

I know what it's like to grow up with few resources, amidst violence and chaos, never feeling safe or appreciated, and wishing I had the guts to kill myself as I cried myself to sleep most nights as a child. I know what it's like to hold the body of my beloved pet because some psycho tortured it to death, and I know what it's like to be sexually abused. I know what it's like to have my prospects ruined by a system that made a clerical error that I had to live with, saddling me with massive debts that I'm still paying. I know what it's like to have police try to bust down our door in the middle of the night, not knowing what we've done wrong (nothing as it turned out). I know what it's like to be held down and kicked in the ribs, while someone takes a run-up and plants his work boot in my head. I know what it's like to have a gun pointed at my head and told I was going to die then and there. I know what it's like to think I'm human trash that will never ever be accepted and should just end things. I know what it's like to be so stressed out and despairing that you only managed to get 8 hours of sleep a month for two months. I know what it's like to have to have to live with aunts and uncles and grandparents because mommy is in a mental hospital, and daddy is off at work. I know what it's like to grow up with domestic abuse going every which way. I'm a white man, and I'm very tired of being told how easy my life is by people who just go by statistics.

&gt;With that come a sense of superiority that can manifest as confidence in  whatever topic. That’s where we can see mansplaining and men getting  all outraged when their advances are rejected by women. There’s no need  to stay self aware if you go un-checked. 

Right, and I'm wondering if perhaps you're not as self-aware as you think you are.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And your gun death statistic clearly doesnt include suicides, which is the leading cause of gun violence in the country. Theres also very solid research proving that access to guns increases suicides in a meaningful way, lots of people who shoot themselves couldnt have slit their own wrists or hung themselves.

The punishment doesn't change anything. Those people are still dead and clearly life in jail isnt a deterrent to the thousands of people who commit premeditated murder every year. What would change things is if those people didnt have guns

My argument is (and write this down so you can respond to the meaningful part of the comment this time) that you and everyone else already gives away their freedoms every day for the common good.

Also, the 2A literally deliberately protects weapons of 'war' for a **REASON**. ya'll encroached on it far enough already anyway.

Now if your serious about fixing the gun violence in America, let's start by giving people healthcare, decent 15-20/hr jobs, better and more affordable housing that they OWN, and do not rent, put these young black boys and girls in decent schools, and start treating everyone equally, then disarm the police, demilitarize them, and start cutting back the military funding.

771,"It seems from these posts that a negative stereotype of America is violence, specifically gun and gang violence. Yes, of course we have that; but it is not near what some of the people here have heard. 

America’s violent crime has fallen off a cliff since its peak somewhere between the 70s-90s. You are generally safe unless you go out looking for trouble. Don’t be stupid. Don’t act tough. Avoid street fights. If you think you may see a drug deal or something go down, mind your business. You are not the police. 

However, you probably won’t see this because most drug exchanges are extremely quick. I know because I buy weed from a dealer (weed is illegal in Florida still) and it takes us 3 seconds. Also, neither me or my dealer would shoot you; are you kidding me? I’m just tryna smoke and he’s just tryna chase his bag. We ain’t hard like that; we’re not Al Capone or Pablo Escobar.

772,"Here’s what needs to happen- we need to fix the fundamental problem here. It’s not guns, knives, explosives or swords. The problem is *Americans wanting to kill each other*.

As you said, it won’t happen- because it means fixing problems like gang shootouts in cities. The gang shootouts are because of drug and crime business disputes. Can’t go to court when a criminal business takes a loss, so the guns come out and kids start getting shot. These businesses pump TONS of “dark money” into politics on both sides of the aisle. So that nixes any motivation to fix that problem .

Fixing school shootings ? The path there is mental health. Why are students so alienated they’re taking loaded weapons to kill their classmates? Once again, solving this problem spells bad news. Because it probably means changing how we do education in this country. Well, that’s not going to fly with the teachers unions of America- organizations who pay politicians to keep things just the way they are. Nor will it fly with education companies who like the status quo- Wall St comes first, right?

But an image of action is needed. A profitable facade , if you will. Gun control laws are just the ticket! By promoting &amp; passing statistically meaningless regulations like magazine restrictions or gun bans, politicians can appear to be “fighting crime” while carefully avoiding actual reforms that could solve the issues. 

Democrats win because their wealthy donors feel “like they’re making a difference”, and the Republicans win because they can pass the hat and claim “dem libruhs gonna take your Grandpa’s Korea War Garand!” 

Gun control is bread and circuses , period. Actually solving the core issues of why there’s violence in America is on no party’s agenda.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
773,"For starters the states around Illinois have laxer gun controle laws than Chicago and the rest of the state has different laws. It would help, you know decrease gun violence is the 3rd largest city if there were some more universally upheld gun laws. Instead you can drive a couple hours to Indiana or Wisconsin buy a gun and then cross back into Illinois to bring your shit to the city.

In New York and LA gun violence is less of a per capita issue and more a raw numbers issue. However, one again the 2 largest cities in America. I’m assuming when Biden’s talking about gun control his focus is the states or more specifically the areas where things like school shootings are happening. 

Also the guy I originally responded too actually can’t back up any of his claims. He’s literally talking out his ass with right-wing propaganda.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
774,"I really didn’t take it as a movie about racism either. The movie showcased inner city violence and the nonsense of it all. The sad reality that good children suffer from gang like violence like Ricky. How incredibly hard it is to make it out of the hood even if you are a decent person with a loving family like Tre. Where Ricky dies by the gun and Tre has to make a decision to avenge him or move on. that was a paradigm shift for his character when he chooses his own future over revenge. A sad reality is that in the real hood Tre would never be given the option. If he said no to the revenge killings his friends might turn on him as well. Giving him no choice and therefore continuing the cycle of violence that pledges the inner city due to extreme poverty, the social climate, and yes systemic racism. White America doesn’t understand that capitalism alone cannot save you from the hood. Because you don’t escape the hood, you survive it.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
775,"I don't have strong feelings one way or the other, but isn't the point not necessarily the ""brutality"" of the shootings, but the frequency and dumbness of the attacks? I understand if there are nations where they have brutal shootings, but most of them are terrorist attacks, politically motivated organized crime, and other religious zealots, which is a different problem, and as you say those people will find a way to hurt others even without guns. However, in America it's mostly kids and/or people with mental health issues who just happened to have access to guns.

It seems silly to me to try to defend guns when just a little bit more restriction could help. That or maybe work on the mental health issues. I live in a country with considerably more violence and insecurity, but considerably less mass shootings in schools and definitely less ""own guns to defend yourself and your property"" beliefs. I've never even seen a gun that is not being held by some sort of police officer. Yeah, criminals will end up with guns anyways, but no one else does. Why is that so bad to aim for?",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
776,"I was in high school when Columbine happened. 

It feels now, like how 9/11 felt versus how we feel today when a thousand people die a day and everyone shruggs it off. 

Back then it was a HUGE deal. Every channel from MTV to CNN to basic cable was talking about it. You went to school and parents were all of a sudden worried about the goth kids and Marilyn Manson. It was what anyone talked about. Watching it on TV as a teenager felt surreal. If definitely felt like a ""This couldn't happen here"" for my 'middle of America' self. I remember thinking ""I wouldn't even know where to buy a gun. How did these kids get *those* kinds of guns. It was everywhere and everyone knew about it. It was on television for months upon months.  It was a huge deal.

Now a school shooting is just a blip in the news. Just another part of America. Its something we tolerate. It is what it is. Cant change it. What can we do? Its the price we pay for freedom some say. (I also think these people haven't lost a child to gun violence in school and think that they would have a different view on this subject the same way someone will tell you Covid is fake or not that serious until their grandparents die of it and then all of sudden their all over Facebook telling everyone how *serious this is*)

And now we have 17 year olds murdering people in the street and some celebrate them like they are our heroes in this country.

Much like how 9/11 was this crazy huge event. Where 3k+ plus Americans lost their lives. We all know. Its something no one will forget. I cried for a week after that. I cried for the families and the lost. I cried from anger. I cried from the joy and passion I felt when I saw *our* country rally around each other. Such terrible loss. One day *thousands* of people lost their lives. 

Now with Coronavirus the death toll is in the HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS and we as a country just casually walk on by. Some dismiss it as fake, a ploy to gain a buck for the doctors, all this death is just a scam to get at Trump because people dont like him. This was once thought to be a horrible situation where we have a rampant outbreak that is killing a thousand Americans a day and some of us are whistling through life checking the stock market each day and wondering when the lazy ass people will get back to work. 

Cant wait for the next 20 years in this country. 
Are we great yet ??",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
777,"It’s baffling that you believe that these two situations are comparable. 

The church is an organization. None of them within the organization is calling the others out on pedophilia. Which is inherently the exact opposite of what the preach.

America is a society of people; not an organization. Also within the society roughly half want stricter gun laws and are calling out the other half for not wanting the same. Also getting rid of guns in America at this point is almost impossible because like many things in society if there is a demand eventually there will be a supply. It’s better to have guns and regulated than to outlaw them and have them in the hands of criminals and the black market.

Gun violence is comparable to the drug war. It’s something you can’t get rid of but you can tax it, regulate it and educate it.

The church is comparable to the police organizations. They need to be exposed, reformed and retrained. Whistleblowers need to be protected and rewarded. Their needs to be a overhaul from the top down and transparency.

But to compare the church pedophilia to gun culture in America is just absurd and ludicrous.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Article**:

&gt; President-elect Joe Biden&amp;apos;s top picks for the Department of Health &amp; Human Services have both declared gun violence a public health issue in the past, much to the ire of gun rights activists and the National Rifle Association. 

&gt; BIDEN DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF TOUTED &amp;apos;MANDATORY BUYBACKS&amp;apos; OF ASSAULT WEAPONS

&gt; Vivek Murthy, a former appointee to HHS under the Obama administration, has long accused politicians of being afraid of the NRA and playing politics with gun control efforts, particularly after the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School where 26 people, including 20 children-- were killed by a gunman. 

&gt; ""Guns are a health care issue,"" Murthy said, in a resurfaced tweet, which put him at odds with Republicans and NRA officials when he was tapped for the post of U.S. Surgeon General under former President Barack Obama in 2014. 

&gt; He was later asked to resign from his position under President Trump. 

&gt;  Another top contender for Biden&amp;apos;s HHS post, Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, has long advocated for a ban on assault weapons and guns in schools, much to the dismay of the NRA. 

&gt; ""It is unacceptable that our children are growing up in a country where they have to worry about gun violence. This is one of the most disturbing and preventable public health crises of this generation, and we owe it to our children to take action."" Raimondo said last year after signing a gun reform bill. 

&gt; CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP

&gt; On the campaign trail, Biden promised to introduce sweeping gun control legislation to add significant amounts of regulation and oversight on guns, with the addition of ""smart guns"" at the center of his policy aimed at reducing firearm violence in America. 

&gt; The NRA, the most notable pro-Second Amendment group in the U.S., called the Biden-Harris the ""most anti-gun presidential ticket in history.""

779,There'd be less gun violence in America if fewer Americans had guns,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
780,"&gt;Personally im more of a centrist. As for your specific question on pro life? I think abortion should be legal but only before brain activity starts. (in other words before the first 5-6 weeks is up) 

Leftist European countries like Denmark have far lower abortion periods than the 26 weeks in the USA. Most limit it to the first trimester or so (12-16 weeks) and in surveys 85% of Americans want more restrictions on abortion. 

I'd call your position ""centrist"" or ""moderate"".

&gt;And also to this point i know a lot of people in the religious side like to say the Bible is against abortion, but to that i say Numbers 5 11-31 directly describes an abortion by chemicals. So thats not really a good argument. (im a christian by the way)

Numbers 5: 11-31 absolutely does not describe an abortion. The passage describes a magical PATERNITY TEST. What is described is a form of divination, a way to get INFORMATION on the father of the baby. 

&gt;I believe we need to focus on American made products and manufacturing (But im pretty sure thats a nonpartisan issue really)

I would argue there is a strong bipartisan consensus AGAINST ""Made in the USA"". Really only the far right, groups like the Minutemen, are pushing against free trade in a serious way. 

So your position here is actually ""far right"". 

&gt;But we need to change our strategy from competing with China, they are in a unique geological location that makes imports of nearly all goods cheap as hell (just from their distance to where location raw products are gathered) 

I think you meant ""cooperating with China"".

And I disagree with your point about raw materials. China has to gather raw materials from all over the world, particularly Southeast Asia and Africa, to manufacture all their crap. 

And Western companies are already doing this. Manufacturing is moving to Vietnam and elsewhere. 

&gt;And we should instead look to bolster our trade with the South America countries, and especially with Mexico and Canada. 

Canada really doesn't make anything. Mexico and most Latin American countries have the same problems, lack of stable governments and widespread criminality. You can't build a factory in a country if every night criminals break in and steal everything. Factories in Mexico are like fortresses. 

As Latin America has proven incapable of forming stable governments on their own the only way to make your plan work would be for the USA to invade Latin America and annex the territory as colonies. I that that would cause more problems than it solves. 

&gt;No matter what we try we will lose every time fighting with China in any kind of trade war. 

The USA is winning the current trade war. The Chinese economy is tanking, especially real estate, and manufacturing is moving to Vietnam and elsewhere as I described above. 

&gt;Their location alone is a gold mine, not to mention their work force. 

As I mentioned, China imports most raw materials and cheap, uneducated, labor is widely available all over the world. The reason it's not exploited is lack of government stability and widespread criminality, as I described above. 

&gt;edit: the main issue with our economy is we are trying to chase that post ww2 economic high. 

Current economic growth based on supply side and neoliberal economics has created, for decades now, more consistent growth than the post-WWII economy. 

&gt;But over time Europe and Asia have recovered and no longer have to rely on our goods.

Both Europe and Asia are completely dependent on USA for intellectual property development, media, and most especially defense. The American military are the ""police force of the world"" protecting international trade ESPECIALLY in China. The  Chinese essentially have no military, the American military IS their military, just like Europe. Pirates are still a very real thing, bigger than ever really. The global economy does not exist without the American military to protect it. 

And Mao utterly destroyed China, killed 100 million people, and reduced almost the entire population into starving peasants. China today would be worse off than North Korea if not for American aid and investment. 

&gt;I think we no matter what we need a good police force but it does need some heavy restructuring. 

To accomplish what goal? 

Though I would start by saying all of your proposals involve DRAMATICALLY INCREASING police budgets, like 5-10 TIMES higher. Are you prepared to pay the massive increase in taxes this would cost? 

I doubt you'll find many leftists supporting that. 

&gt;Treat them more like how we treat doctors.

So pay them a starting salary of at least $100,000? 

&gt;They have to have license to work in law enforcement and if they are caught with misconduct that license is revoked and they are banned from police work, just like doctors who are found guilty of malpractice.

It's near-impossible for a doctor to be removed due to malpractice and this system would have no effects on the police work that people are complaining about. For example, in the recent deaths of George Floyd, Breanna Taylor, and Jacob Blake police were all following procedure. 

And it would cost lots of money to build this database, literally millions of Federal dollars. That may seem excessive but I've done Federal IT and that's what it costs. A lot of money for something that's useless. 

&gt;And there needs to be an annual test to make sure the police are up to standards throughout their carrier. Yeah they got that one fitness exam when they enter, but how many just let themselves go afterwards. 

So you believe one of the major problems with police is that they're not physically fit enough?

I've worked a lot with police officers and IME they generally have the exact opposite problem, the officers are too 'body proud' and too physically oriented. The average young officer, of any race, tends to be a 'brah' type. Police work doesn't attract intellectuals. 

&gt;not to mention to keep them up to date with laws and advances in tech (saw a vid where a officer pulled a guy over for ""having a computer mounted to his dash"" not realizing it was a tesla and that it was stock and it was just ac controls, gas, speedometer and such.

Police work doesn't attract intellectuals. It's high-risk work for low pay. Intelligent people don't sign up for that. 

I'd complain once again about the costs of all that training but officers wouldn't bother to show up. 

&gt;Our right to bear arms needs to be protected but we do need better gun regulations. Less so in what guns you can and cant have but more on the distribution. 

I strongly disagree. Gun restrictions in the USA are already draconian and completely ineffective. I would call these polices ""far left"". 

&gt;Universal background checks, 

Already in place. 

&gt;laws with more bite for gun shops that ignore laws, 

Gun shops literally never ignore laws, that's pure bullshit. Cite some cases. 

&gt;banning people convicted of domestic violence, 

CONVICTED? Already in place. Domestic violence is a felony and felons aren't allowed to possess firearms. 

Current ""red flag"" laws allow firearms to be seized without any due process, no conviction, no court hearing, not even an accusation (completely anonymous). 

&gt;laws with more bite for the sell of guns at gun shows so they can't be used as loop holes. 

You have no idea what the ""gun show loophole"" is, do you? 

The ""gun show loophole"" is literally all private sales and transfers of firearms. I'm Bob Smith, not a gun dealer but average citizen, and I want to sell my Glock 17 to my neighbor Joe Blow. I can sell that firearm to Joe Blow with no check against the NCIS criminal database because Bob Smith has no access to that database. There are restrictions on VOLUME, how many firearms can be transferred. 

""Closing the gun show loophole"" means requiring all gun transfers be made through a licensed gun dealer who performs an NCIS database check. Several States such as California, Oregon, and Washington have tried to implement this and it's been shot down on Constitutional grounds. 

&gt;Basically keep the guns out of the hands of criminal hands.

Your proposed restrictions, unquestionably proven time and time again, do absolutely nothing to keep firearms out of criminal hands. 

The vast majority of firearms used in crime are STOLEN. They were not legally acquired. 

A large percentage of firearms crimes (40%?) are committed by minors who can't even legally own firearms. 

&gt;We need to keep the distribution of drugs still illegal but the use needs to be decriminalized. 

Okay. 

&gt;Addicts dont need a jail cell where they more often to not still get more of the very same drugs if not worse drugs. 

Addicts on the street will obviously do a lot MORE drugs and they will commit crimes to get the money for those drugs. 

&gt;they need help to treat the underlying cause of their use and addiction. 

Voluntary treatment has been shown not to work and involuntary mental health and especially drug treatment is completely illegal and unconstitutional in the USA. 

Many people do not understand that latter fact. The ONLY WAY to send an adult in the USA to a mental hospital against their will is if they have been CONVICTED of a major crime like murder. That's it, period. Mental health or drug treatment can be offered as an ALTERNATIVE to prison. 

Again, in the USA criminal conviction is the ONLY WAY to force someone into mental health or drug treatment. 

&gt;If they are locked in a jail cell they just become a burden being propped up by tax dollars, with barely a chance of ""pulling themselves up by their bootstraps"".

In-patient mental health and drug treatment costs 10 TIMES as much as prison. That's one of the big reasons the US government stopped doing these things.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
781,"Everyone brings up Australia. They changed their mass shooting statistic form 3+ to 4+ (aka less mass shootings) it actually hasn’t changed. Violent crime has not decreased. Poor statistics to fit their narrative that their gun laws “worked” 

There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. U.S. population 324,059,091 as of Wednesday, June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.0000925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:

• 65% of those deaths are by suicide which would never be prevented by gun laws • 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified • 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons – gun violence • 3% are accidental discharge deaths

So technically, ""gun violence"" is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Well, first, how are those deaths spanned across the nation? • 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago • 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore • 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit • 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)

So basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.

This basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.

Now, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, so it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. So if all cities and states are not created equally, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.

Are 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault all is done by criminals and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. That's why they are criminals.

But what about other deaths each year? • 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT! • 36,000-60,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths • 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide)

Now it gets good: • 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! So what is the point? If the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides......Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions!

So you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? It's pretty simple.: Taking away guns gives control to governments.

The founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the British did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. It is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.

Thus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the U.S. Constitution. It must be preserved at all costs.

So the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: ""Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword, because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be.”

783,"Break into their house and hold them at gun point and then say “just a prank bro” which grants legal immunity under bro code 1.72 subsection broske.

Honestly though, putting the fear of collapse and right wing terrorism normally does it. Once someone understands how unstable the world is and how primed for violence America is it becomes scary knowing you’re completely naked and could never defend yourself from someone with a gun. 

It also helps to understand that cops show up after crimes are committed and in a real world situation they may not even be available to assist you if they chose to do so (most people don’t know the can legally ignore your calls for help). 

I convinced my family with one sentence. “If someone comes at you guys with a gun all I can do is watch you all die”. Their eyes opened wide and after a week they asked me to take them to the range.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
784,"I understand what you mean and in some way it’s true, but in my country at least, I don’t see police as an institution of violence, but simply as protection. Here, police are focused on deescalation and restoring order, and as a final tool they have a monopoly to violence. And they’re trained for it, and they’re trained not to kill but to stop the threat. You can’t expect that from citizens, and what we see in the US is exactly that. Citizens can’t behave with guns, they’re not properly trained, and it just creates more dangerous situations. I watched a documentary once and according to that film, fear is the biggest threat to America. Everyone fears the world in the US. And I think that’s true, and that’s why people like to have guns. But I feel a lot safer to be in a country where I know the chance of someone pulling out a gun is extremely small. One lunatic with a gun is enough to kill a lot of people, and that’s also what happens in schools and bars and concerts in the US. And before you say guns are then useful to stop mass shootings, that’s not true. Because according to the FBI, if I remember correctly, around 2% of all mass shootings are stopped by armed citizens. The rest is all law enforcement. 

Citizens just aren’t trained for guns. In some states you have to do a few hours of training and then you get a license, and that license is legal in many other states. And the only thing they teach you is how to handle a gun, and how to aim. And nothing else. Not judging a situation, not making correct decisions based on threats, not how to react to a mass shooting; shoot and kill with a little bit of safety, is what that is about. And that’s exactly why law enforcement is better than giving everyone a gun. Maybe it’s a little bit different than I think it is, because admittedly, I’m not American, but I have done my research on this matter.

And looking at the statistics is enough, let’s be honest. More murders, more mass shootings, more crime than countries that don’t have guns, like European countries, or have way more strict gun laws.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
785,"We exist, its just that by speaking our beliefs in a public forum, SJWs will call us racist bigots, right wing assholes or some made up Tumblr insult that sounds like something a 3 year old would say. Then right wingers will call us stupid commies who don't understand economics and wave an American flag in our face claiming patriotism. We're a nation founded on rebelling against a former regime, blind allegiance to a flag kind of goes against what our nation was built on, but hey, whatevs.

Time for the stereotypical Lib Left wall of text.

I believe in leftist economic policies for both the good of myself, as I'm a government worker and in a union, and my nation. Deregulation, tax cuts and supply side oriented economics encourage a wealth gap, unethical actions by businesses that harm the country and all disproportionately benefit the rich rather than the average American, and all this has a historical precedent. The wealth gap was a reasonably important factor in causing the Great Depression. Healthy regulations would have helped to prevent banks from essentially gambling with the money they held, helping to eliminate one of the factors that caused the Great Recession. Outside America, in Russia prior to the Communists taking power, the bottom 50% of the country only owned around 15% of the country's wealth, so inequality in wealth can be a catalyst for a country's downfall.

With automation removing jobs from the economy, the rich who can afford to automate jobs pay an upfront cost, then essentially collect the income the former workers would have. From a moral perspective, if you remove jobs from the economy, you should have to pay the social costs of supporting those former workers with your taxes. In the end, I really could give less than a shit about the country's GDP if most of its citizens don't have more buying power each year, and their income isn't keeping up with the cost of living and/or inflation.

Socially, Im mostly libertarian but each stance has caveats. I believe in gun ownership, with the caveat of having to register them/have their ballistics recorded and prove you still own them/haven't committed a crime with them once a year. Anyway, in America, theyre so widespread and people have such strong opinions on the Second Amendment that removing them entirely from society would cause more harm than good. Legalizing or decriminalizing all drugs would be an important part of harm reduction, and there's proof of this in the places that have taken this step, and besides, its your body, do what you want to it as long as you don't affect others with your actions. Have sex with whatever other consenting adults you like. Worship whatever religion you want as long as you don't negatively impact others, and if you do, prepare to get deported or meet your damn God if you kill others because of them, preferably in a manner that sends you to your religion's hell. For example, death by suffocation on bacon for jihadists would be ideal.

Freedom of speech should be given to everyone, but not freedom of repercussions from it. You say something awful about another race or person? Fine. Doesn't mean your job can't fire you for it. Inciting violence though should have some legal repurcussions because now your actions are affecting the ability of others to live their lives. SJWs are scum for wanting to remove that, because without free speech you don't have a free society.

This all puts me firmly lib left, though my caveats for certain things move me to the center of the compass' libertarian half, and my desire for capitalism with heavy social safety nets and programs with reasonable taxes on the rich (Reasonable meaning large enough that less than 1% of the population doesn't hold a greater and greater percentage of the country's wealth every year while poor people work 3 McWageSlave jobs just to make ends meet.) rather than pure socialism puts me in the middle of the left half.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1) Oh lord the guardian, roflmao.

2) Fewer guns do reduce gun deaths. This is a non-sequitor when talking about crime.

3) Could you ACTUALLY tell me the relative risk ratio of that so called erudite research or are you unable to actually be bothered to fact check your own sources?

&gt;Sounds just like America, where the GOP has prevented the CDC from even collecting data on gun violence to study it.

Not true:

&gt;The Dickey Amendment is a provision first inserted as a rider into the 1996 United States federal government omnibus spending bill which mandated that ""none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) *may be used to advocate or promote gun control.*

The CDC is not the BOJ, FBI, Secret Service, DOJ or any actual department related to crime. Nor are they the Commerce Bureau, Border and Customs, or Consumer Protection Bureau. They have no business advocating any policy related to guns. None.

BTW, I'm noting your weasel phrase ""sounds just like."" Weak logic.

 &gt;Again, just like America with vast swathes of uninhabited farmland as well as modern cities like Sydney and Chicago.

Nope. The entire population of the LA area is more than the entire population of Australia. 

24.99 million to 28 (appox) million. COPE.

&gt;Damn, now you're unironically using white nationalist talking points?

Ooof. Guilt by association fallacy and weak ad hom with no evidence what so ever. I specifically said its not a race thing. It's when cultures clash, particularly in an ongoing battle where one has institutionally disenfranchized the other. 

I'm amazed at your ability to literally ignore the words I've said myself so you can insert your own reality into it. Delusional. This proves I am dealing with a person who is not looking for truth to inform their decisions but for a justification for authority which informs itself, which is why facts can be altered and distorted however you want. 

&gt;So you think crime is just inevitable?

Wuuuuuuuuuuut. Where are you getting this honey? You're off your rocker. Who are you arguing against? 

&gt; It's been falling precipitously for decades.

Yep, despite the fact the population is more armed than ever before (ooops.)

Really you cannot read a damn word I say can you? 

&gt;It's not about them being correlated with any specific crime

Reading. Comprehension. I said ANY crime aka crime in general. 

&gt; it's that they are more lethal

They're more accurate which means they're less likely to hit a bystander. And as far as lethality goes, that doesn't really mean much because you can't conceal it and thus that's why 90%+ of people who are committing crimes are using HANDGUNS.

&gt;That's why the US' 1994 Assault Weapons Ban may not have reduced the number of mass shootings

OH LOL the MENTAL GYMNASTICS.

&gt;When you fit a statistical model that fits a gradual impact [and looks at a counterfactual in which a ban isn’t in place] … the number of people who are shot in public mass shootings goes down roughly by 10 percent every year that the law was in place

OH LMFAO. Have you ever taken a college level statstics class? This sentence alone should tee you off that you need to carefully read the methods used. So what's the relative risk ratio (of I suppose) this observational study? Do you even know what I'm saying?",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
787,"&gt;Restrictions on gun ownership is very common around the world and it clearly works on a broad level in most of Europe, Oceania and East Asia.

You just swept over most of the world as if Pangaea was a unified state with uniform gun laws. Gun laws in a country such as Switzerland are nothing like a country like Japan. This isn't strictly a case of the US vs everyone else.

&gt;Similarly, [Australia](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2019/mar/20/strict-firearm-laws-reduce-gun-deaths-heres-the-evidence) is a case study in guns laws becoming significantly more restrictive, in this case after the Port Arthur massacre, and it seems as though, yes, it did result in a massive reduction in the amount of guns in the country. There was also a massive reduction in all gun related deaths, but I'll let you decide if that was a direct result of more stringent gun laws or unrelated factors based on what study you want to read. 

The case of Australia pretty hard to prove. It shows that the number of gun deaths went down, but the number of gun deaths was already trending downward before that. Additionally the murder rate only dropped slightly and has actually returned more or less to where it was before the restrictions.

&gt;Fundamentally the war on drugs has been a failure, in a way that gun legislation has not been. Its a bad analogy from the start, you can't get addicted to guns and its difficult to use them to spice up a party or time at the club every week. 

I'm not saying the consumption pattern is the same. No one is becoming addicted to snorting 9 mm rounds. I am saying the attempts to curtail illegal distribution have failed.

&gt;Most regular people in first world countries outside of America are unfamiliar with guns, and aren't interested in making them more numerous, there just isn't the appetite to break the law for guns in the way there is for drugs, and its illuminating to me that gun legislation is really not very controversial at all in Europe and similar places compared to almost every other issue, when it does come up its usually in response to criminal uses to make the law even more restrictive. 

I don't see how this is relevant. If you're looking at guns from a global perspective, then you should be reading my paragraph how guns have led to important historical developments. Developments that are especially important if you're a leftist. Both Orwell and Marx who I mentioned were basically ""Take it from my cold dead hands"" progun people and neither one of them was American.

&gt;You're willing to bet? Find the data or don't, until you do this is useless and bizarre speculation that brings nothing to the conversation. 

While data on the race of the victims of mass shootings is elusive, [the race of the perpetrators is easy to find](https://www.statista.com/statistics/476456/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-shooter-s-race/). As the majority are white, and most murders are committed against people as the same race of the victim, I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that the victims are mostly white. Additionally I think the point about a mass of people on the Vegas strip being prioritized by rich liberals compared to poor inner city neighborhoods is pretty easy to grasp.

&gt;The headlines about shifts in public opinion on gun control obscure the fact that on the whole, [most people would still prefer that laws legislating the sale of firearms should in fact be more strict](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx) 

My point about gun control losing popularity this year isn't an appeal to the idea that I'm right because the majority is on my side. It's a strategic argument that, even if they're in the minority, gun owners are very strong politically and going up against then will cause an uphill battle for your campaign.

&gt;Black people have [significantly larger concerns about gun crimes in their local communities than white people](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/views-of-guns-and-gun-violence/), but also [own them at lower rates compared to White people](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/) and are more likely to say that access to legal guns contributes to gun violence to some degree or another, and say that if there were more guns there would be more crime. Its difficult to find statistics that just plainly lay out black peoples feelings on gun control compared to white people overall, but I think it be inferred from this stuff, along with the fact that Black are overwhelmingly Democrat leaning, and the fact that Democrat voters has significantly more interest in gun control than Republicans, that Black are much more in favor of gun control than the population at large. I have no idea why you are trying to present this as an issue that only appeals to air headed white people (heaven forbid of course that anyone feel nervous at the thought they could be caught up in a mass shooting at a club or concert alongside dozens of other people), but it really just doesn't. 

I will first point out something that I forgot to mention in the post. A good amount of the modern history of gun control is explicitly racist. Ronald Reagan, who passed more gun control than any other politician in American history, passed the Mulford Act explicitly to curtail black ownership of guns.

Now, the article suggests that even though more black people think more guns will lead to more crime, they are still not the majority. Additionally, I don't see how black people's or any group of people's, views on this are relevant. Either guns cause more crime or they don't, popularity is irrelevant. On party popularity, while it is true that black people strongly support the Democratic Party, [less than 30% identify as liberal](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/27/5-facts-about-black-democrats/), so I don't think a direct correlation is necessarily implied.

&gt;Finally regarding the revolutionary use of guns, there's multiple problems. First, I think I agree with Noam Chomsky on this, fundamentally, the government has tanks and jet fighters and you don't. Civilian gun ownership just doesn't matter that much if the actual aim is to fight and win a genuine, full scale civil war against a modern military, it simply can't compare to what a centralized government can bring to bear, and this counts more in America than anywhere else. Maybe it was different in the 19th century (though I doubt it from what I know), but even then something like the Russian Revolution had to rely on the total collapse of the Tsarist state in the wake of the Great War. In contrast the Paris Commune was dashed against the formidable rocks of state power when it came down to the wire. I don't think people who think that America's gun problems are a small price to pay for the possibility to launch a war really know what they are talking about, most successful revolutions are dependent on mass defection by the military (something that was absolutely critical in the Russian Civil War), or massive amounts of support from outside powers (this was most obviously the case with the American revolution, it would have gone nowhere if the revolutionaries could not rely on the support of the major European powers arrayed against Britain). 

I do not agree at all. The fact that states, including large states, have powerful, established, militaries has been with us for thousands of years hasn't changed the fact that revolutions have been able to topple those states. Today, countries are still toppled by revolutions. You also pretend that if there were to be a revolt in the US or anywhere else, that there would be zero defections from the military. If military defections have happened in dozens of revolutions throughout history, why would they not happen in a hypothetical American revolt?

&gt;The best I could envision is that gun ownership became much more prevalent among genuine leftists, but I think that would just cause an arms race and I'd put my money on reactionaries in that case, since the forces of capital would have a much larger interest in making sure those guys are better armed. 

That's part of the reason why I'm writing this piece. The fact that the guns in this country are mostly controlled by conservatives isn't exciting, it's scary. I want leftists to own guns as well, otherwise there's a massive power imbalance coupled with a failure to understand this issue as leftists are largely uninterested in guns.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
788,"First it’s not Nazis you might want to research a Nazi, I believe black males have been purposely targeted. Infact I would love to see the black communities not constantly have to deal with crime and poverty. Second this doesn’t prove anything it’s stating that for the majority of non violent crime it’s numerically incorrect, not stating that in high poverty areas where the majority of minorities live there isn’t more calls then in non minority communities. Violent crime was subject of the conversation not targeted small to mild crime, majority of violence is in poverty communities in America which happen to be mostly minority not saying I can blame people for being hostile in shitty living conditions. But there has been no love from the “Leaders” or the black culture infact the injustices that have been handed to the minority communities is a predisposition of failure. There are a MILLION reasons crime is higher in high poverty areas but looking at leadership and Idle-ship should be addressed. I have not seen one rap video or Hollywood video depicting black males as more then gun toting, drug dealing, criminals. Maybe if the image of a strong black man wasn’t a murdering drug dealer there would be less violence, maybe depicting groups of people as people would have a better affect on minority children. How many black kids get affection from there fathers in low income communities? As a whole yes violent crime is significantly higher in poverty stricken areas, and ideology such as your only hurts instead of addressing the many issues that could help. Sadly this will not change because people don’t want to help so I am going to assume your a Nazi who hates minority communities as I want to see America be Americans with no color boundaries.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

790,"&gt;Donald Trump and his surrogates’ attempts to overturn the results of U.S. election have prompted waves of panic, ridicule, and disbelief. The effort has proved an embarrassment, with a disastrous track record in court and increasing resistance from Republican officials. But for closer watchers of the far-right fringes that the president has helped grow and nurture during his administration, the outcome of the charade has never been the concern. 

&gt;Experts on radicalization and deradicalization are less worried about what will happen with Trump—and more worried about what his diehard supporters will do in a post-Trump America.“This keeps me up at night,” John Horgan told me over the phone. He’s a Georgia State professor and the director of the Violent Extremism Research Group, which examines what pushes people to political violence. Joe Biden won the election, but groups like the Proud Boys and the Boogaloo movement aren’t fading away. “I think for many of these movements, their moment has come,” Horgan said. “I think we’re truly in free fall, and don’t have any sense of how to grasp this.”

&gt;Horgan has long put himself in the minds of extremists to understand what fuels them. He’s aware that by warning others of their potential for violence, he could be playing into their hands. But he’s not willing to play down the threat he sees. “If you need to terrify yourself, that’s often what these groups want us to do. But the warning signs are all around us,” he said. “I want to be wrong about this, but I see short- and medium-term violence in our future. It’s all around us.”

&gt;Political violence in the United States is already trending upward. Armed insurgency groups are recruiting with higher success rates. And in some states, they are activated. In the months leading up to election, a teenager persuaded by militiamen-style propaganda allegedly shot and killed anti-police protesters, an antifa sympathizer allegedly shot and killed an opponent, and more generally, Americans’ opinion on whether political violence is justifiable has shifted. Many experts in countering violent extremist—known as CVE in insider speak—fear it may already be too late to steer clear of what comes next.

&gt;“Doomsday cults—when the world doesn’t get destroyed on their magic day, what do they do? They’re the object of ridicule. And that will be what will push people over the edge,” said Mubin Shaikh, a counterextremist consultant in Canada. The conspiracy Q has especially struggled since Election Day, when Trump was supposed to have dominated the returns. In his book Undercover Jihadi, Shaikh recalled how he felt alienated in his Canadian hometown as a young Muslim, and on a trip to his parent’s hometown in Pakistan in the 1990s, he started developing sympathies for—and eventually joined—the Taliban. Today, he works with law enforcement to stage interventions with religious radicals before they get too far gone. He’s been watching the political situation in America deteriorate, and he’s worried about the months ahead.

&gt;To help put the threat into perspective, some experts like Shaikh and pundits have used foreign examples. Many are squeamish to draw parallels between a violent apocalyptic group like ISIS with seemingly impotent online conspiracy groups like QAnon, but others fluent in deradicalization told me the psychological underpinnings between these groups overlap too much to deny.

&gt;Colin P. Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, a global security research group, told me, “The reason a kid like Kyle Rittenhouse would go grab a gun and join a local militia is the same reason why somebody would be lured to a Jihadi group.” He’s closely familiar with right-wing and anti-government extremism groups like the Boogaloo Bois. “It’s identity. It’s grievances they have that are being exploited and magnified,” he said. “And there’s this constant call to get off the couch and get off your ass and go do something. Like, ‘You be the guy that goes and defends whatever.’ Groups are different, the ideologies are different, but a lot of the messaging and the narrative are the same.”

&gt;Shaikh said he sees the valorization of Rittenhouse on right-wing media as a key ingredient in violent political upheaval. “What we have seen in the last four years is a hardening of attitudes. This is ideological indoctrination. This is how experts look at it,” he said. “Any group or ideologue or cult that is putting out a message of fierce loyalty, vicious rejection of anyone who opposes, and a made-up mind that victory was promised and was stolen—that idea of grievance, secret loss, those are the kinds of things that get people off the computer screen and out into the streets to kill people. And that’s exactly the narrative we’re seeing now.”

791,"Most people don’t learn about tax brackets in school, especially a rural public school. With the added confusion from conservative news sources, it’s understandable that people think it means more taxes in general. When you explain it to them, they may say something about how they’ll make that much eventually out of pride, but they were probably unaware, and it isn’t explained explicitly and clearly in the type of language that is used in rural America. 

The other reason why they buy into this narrative is because one of the tangible rewards they see is Republican presidents tend to pad refunds for poor families while they give huge tax cuts to corporations and high income earners (I think this started with Nixon, but don’t quote me). This leads them to believe the extra money they see is from “tax cuts” when in reality one has nothing to do with the other. Bill Clinton had a good handle on working America, and he significantly increased these credits. An extra $5,000 or more a year can increase quality of life for a family living below the poverty line to an almost unimaginable extent, and if they believe there is a risk of that being taken away from them they will defend it no matter how illogical it may seem. Biden inspires no confidence that he will fight to maintain or increase such programs. This is also a point of pride for hardworking families in the south, because although it is a welfare program, it isn’t viewed as such culturally and so it doesn’t feel shameful like food stamps might. 

Republicans also tend to favor lax regulations and taxes on businesses both big and small, which can make or break struggling businesses in rural areas. Republicans also support hunting and gun ownership, something that can be a very real source of food for those in the Midwest, Appalachia and the south. While liberal voters tend to see guns in an urban environment and equate them to violence, rural voters see guns not only as a symbol of the ability to defend their home and country, but also as a means to eat, and as a time honored tradition and lifestyle. Despite Bush being the president who actually outlawed assault rifles, it is liberal politicians who take a vocal stance on gun control, making them villains to those who have a culture in which guns have a starring role. To me, this has been one of the biggest missteps in the Democratic Party. 

The lax regulations I mentioned also lead to something else that is often overlooked - cheap gas. This has been mentioned by almost every conservative voter I’ve talked to. 

As far as Biden’s “clear plan”, that can also fall through, and conservative politicians appeal to people in dying industries by telling them they’ll be able to keep their jobs (usually under the vague promise that there will be less resources imported, so demand will increase). Can you tell me what actual jobs Biden plans on creating in rural West Virginia and Kentucky that people would be qualified for to replace the coal industry? What about for all the oil and gas workers in Texas, North Dakota, and throughout the Midwest? Because I haven’t heard of any, and I bet they haven’t either. In areas where Walmart, factories, and nonrenewable energy are the only jobs, the threat of unemployment can be a huge motivation. 

Another tangible reward that most democrats don’t think of is pay increases for the armed forces. Republicans aren’t loud about their support for the military for no reason. They know that it appeals to poor, uneducated voters because it’s their kids enlisting. Sign on bonuses, increased base pay and more troops also mean more money for families struggling to survive.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
792,"The vast majority of anti-gun stances come from 2 things

1. An adherence to 'non-violence'.
2. Revulsion to them due to their association with facist militias in America.

1 - Point out that there is no such thing as non-violence. Violence happens to some people whether we choose as individuals to be non-violent or not. We don't choose IF violence happens but WHERE. If you are an adherent to typical leftist non-violence, then you are choosing that the violence happen to minorities, to prisoners, to workers, to those who are otherwise victimized by the powerful. By becoming willing to do violence yourself, you create the possibility to choose a different location for the violence to take place (with those who victimize).

2 - They're right to notice that the current state of the 2nd amendment in the US, and gun rights in general, have served to arm the right wing of the country at the expense of the left. Even where people were legally carrying and should have been protected, either the government or the overall media have served to demonize them (Black Panthers / Philando Castile). Your right to bear arms is directly connected to your willingness and ability to protect the real victims of the capitalist order, not to a piece of paper. *( . . . I realize that might be a spicy meatball for this sub, but I'm gonna go out on a limb on this one. But I have a feeling that most people would support the idea of the ability to protect ourselves regardless of a document drafted by a bourgeoise democracy.)*",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

794,"I do agree that one officer going to a call like is unsafe for all. But do realize that there are many places in North America where only one officer responds which is not bad. 

I'm fully supporting and trying to explain that my service has this type of joint response in place and its touted worldwide for its effectiveness. 

Also, sure in this case him finding out police were coming elevated him and I get that, but also maybe they were coming anyway. If we get a call for someone and they have a history with police, based on that Police would be responding because of prior acts of violence and the other support would always request it. Our EMS won't go to an address that is flagged with someone dangerous even if that person is just calling to get a ride to hospital. 

Also the other issue is that this assumes the Police weren't the ones coming to help him. How's that for a stigma. The Police do help. Admittedly there occasions highlighted recently in the media when they don't but the fact is only an incredibly small percentage of police interactions are negative. Its the .1% that get highlighted. 

I agree with your points and my comments were definitely more directed to the article OP posted and how flawed this initiative will be. 

Also whether its one or 2, if you charge at an officer with a knife you are getting shot. Sorry but they want to go home to their family. Charging equals shot. The times people survive those is usually during a negotiation when someone has a weapon but are not actively using it. A person in crisis pacing with a knife is getting tased. The person running towards a cop is getting shot 10 out of 10 times. Its unfortunate but mental health or not a knife/gun etc is still a deadly weapon and deadly force is allowed.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
795,"&gt; Mass shootings kill half as many people as commercial airlines.

I choose if I get on an airplane.  

No one at that concert in Vegas signed up for 'maybe I'll fall out of the sky.  Maybe, today there's a pissed off guy with as many AR15s as he can get.'

You note how few people are killed with anything NFA.  Well, how many FNA weapons are in circulation?  I'd argue fewer in circulation and them being harder to obtain leads to fewer of them being pulled in dumbass situations.  Fewer of their owners are the unhinged ass clowns that will occupy a government building or try to kidnap a governor.

Further restricting access to that level of firepower HAS lowered the deaths from it compared to, say, pre-regulations in which the Tommy Gun was the iconic AW of its time.

I get the legal rationale behind no warnings / no wounding - but it's also insane.  If there's any way for me to remove the threat without killing, I should!

Presently, I'm quite happy to retreat if able and lethal force as an absolute last resort.

While the overall homicide rate has gone down (which would indicate to me the need for 'home defense' is considerably lower) the mass shooting rate has NOT gone down.

I can choose to avoid the risk of air travel by choosing not to get on an airplane.  Your freedom is not infringed by my choosing not to use that service.

I don't get the choice of if I want to send my kid to a 'we might have a school shooter' school - cuz that sure hasn't gone down.

You mention Scandanavian countries - Switzerland makes a CC permit very hard to get.

Also - they have already dealt with the societal issues most point to being the root of our problem in the first place.  If you have free access to mental health, virtually no homelessness, 1/4 the homicide rate of the US, free education, free healthcare - you're a lot less stressed out in the first place.

I'd argue they're proof that, culturally, the US is not ready for the best-possible AW with high capacity magazines in public circulation.

If we achieved such a happy and educated society - one in which racial and police murder are relatively unheard of compared to the US - maybe then we'd be ready.

We're a very young country.  Our people are angry, afraid, and armed.  https://www.thecut.com/2016/12/america-is-failing-the-bad-break-test-and-people-are-dying.html

Til then, I can't even count on some parent to keep their 17 year old from bringing a gun to a protest in another state to go play wannabe-cop.  I can't count on the most responsible-ist gun owner who taught their kids to be responsible not to bring the gun to school.

They just do not have this problem in the Scandanavian countries.

796,"&gt;I don't agree, but if this is the case, why bother having any laws then?

Because this is nearly unenforceable. If someone gets murdered, evidence can be collected, the case can be brought to court, and the guilty can be punished. If someone is illegally walking around with a gun and plans to use it maliciously you aren't going to know about it until it is too late. All you're doing is depriving law abiding citizens from protecting themselves.

&gt;Also, if you regulate guns and don't allow so many out in the community, you can reduce harm in those areas. 

Again, poverty came first and caused the violence, not the other way around. And very few people are actually providing a reasonable way of doing this.

&gt;The potential to cause more harm is there.

We aren't talking about potential, we are talking about what actually is causing the deaths and rifles are not the cause.

&gt;Looks like they have less guns than America though.

Okay but it isn't the sheer number of guns that kills people, you don't need a lot of guns to kill someone, only one.

&gt;Oh, yeah. Poor Victoria who now has basically eliminated COVID and avoided mass deaths through a temporary lockdown and are now getting back to life as normal, while in the US 1,000 people are dying every day, but at least you have your freedumb! 

You're right, an unnecessary police state that crushes the most vulnerable people in society is totally worth it.

&gt;You do know that people still have guns in Australia, don't you?

So, essentially America and it's politicians are seeing masks and adhering to guidance and regulations as losing the argument that covid is legitimate. 

So basically, America is going to embrace covid as much as it embraces gun violence.  It's not going anywhere under GOP leadership. We're putting the economy ahead of the pandemic, which makes zero sense logically.  

And it feels like America is suffering from affluenza. The only problems we can solve are ones that can be buried in money, anything that requires people to use their brains, be patient, be reasonable. So they just say fuck that, they just need instant gratification, they don't care if it's a crapshoot survival rate for anyone high-risk, they can't possibly concede to the point that they took the wrong side on covid 7 months ago.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can't compare that to an extremely diverse country of 330 million, where guns are already flooded into society. In most rural areas of the US, there are very few gun-related homicides. Most gun-related homicides are in highly population-dense areas. Additionally, the U.S. is extremely culturally diverse and attitudes torward violence and guns vary so much more than likely a fairly similar group on a small French island. I'm not meaning to say America does not have a problem with violence. I just don't think that is a fair comparison.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; In a year, Australia purchased about 650,000 firearms from private residents, estimated to represent about 20% of the country’s privately owned guns. Research evaluating the effects of the buyback found a 42% decrease in homicide rates and a 57% decrease in suicide rates in the seven years after the legislation passed.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
801,"I agree with you on all those points. I used to live in the city with the most murders in Canada. Lots of street gangs, rough inner city. There’s some gun violence, and sometimes other weapons, but absolutely nowhere near the number of homicides per capita as pretty much any US city. The widespread availability of handguns is the difference. 

I believe it’s a false cause argument to say all these other issues need to be addressed at the same time: without handheld killing tools available literally everywhere, these incidents become much less lethal. Fewer moms lose their sons.

It’s obvious that handguns in America aren’t going anywhere. But if magically overnight there were the same number of handguns per capita in Chicago as there are in Toronto, the drop in annual homicides would be staggering - and suicides even more so.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
802,"You get that an ""assault weapon"" is just a made up term for semi-automatic rifles to make them sound scary, yeah? 

As for why not to ban ""assault weapons"", how about some basic math: [FBI homicide data](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls). Of homicides involving firearms with a reported type, in 2017, **handguns** accounted for 92% of the cases, and rifles of all kinds only 5%. 

So why are people pushing so hard on banning the kind of weapon that is used in 5% or less of firearm involved homicides and *ignoring* the 92%? Because they're latching onto the public's fears of mass shootings, and aren't actually trying to address gun violence.

The ar-15 pattern rifle is the most commonly owned rifle in America. There are some 5-10 million of them in the US. And every year, there's some 250-400 homicides involving rifles of *any* kind. When we talk about an assault weapon ban, we're talking about making millions of Americans felons unless they surrender their legally purchased property, which they have used for to commit no crime, and have a Constitutional right to own.

Given how poorly the police treat the public, as we've seen demonstrated time and again this year, this is begging for the police to swat people and will result in people unnecessarily killed. Some of those will be 2A absolutists who make good on their ""from my cold dead hands"" promise, and some will be people that the police raid at midnight without knocking and light up.

The actual purpose of the 2nd amendment is to have an armed populace. Not for hunting, not for shooting paper targets, not for home defense when something goes bump in the night. In the post-revolutionary war era, personal armament didn't just stop at rifles either. Some civilians owned cannons and a few rather wealthy gentlemen owned their own battleships, the pinnacle of military technology available at the time. Obviously the modern armaments available to civilians falls well short of that mark these days.

That may seem absurd or unnecessary, and there's an argument to be made for that. But if you want to change it, then repeal the 2nd Amendment instead of trying to whittle down the Bill of Rights until it is meaningless.

Now I'm personally in favor of some restrictions on gun ownership. I'm ok with requirements for background checks and waiting periods, willing to accept red flag laws. But I'm not in favor of laws which are ineffective, and only serve as a hassle or legal minefield for the law abiding. I'm not in favor of criminalizing a large swath of Americans for ownership rather than actions.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. America can’t be the greatest country on the planet and imminently taking us over. The two just aren’t synonymous. Realistically if they really wanted to enslave us, their tanks and drones and organization and navy and ability to embargo etc would more than outclass the average proud boy with a camouflage vest and a plastic jar to piss in while he plays vigilante with his drinking buddies. 

Also it’s very much worth noting that Iraq was a heavily citizen-owning gun rich country that’s government took it over so that little “tyrannical” government argument is just a complete fallacy and a fantasy. 

2. I believe he’s right, hunting rifles, shotguns, hand pistols would still be available to people and are more than sufficient for hunting or home defense. 

3. European countries border way more countries on average than America does. They also have connections to Turkey and consequently terrorists that disguise as refugees. Europe has far more substantial problems than just “drug smugglers” and gang members from south of the border. Suicide bombers, jihadists murdering teachers, subway attacks etc it has its share of problems that far exceed America’s daily issues and most Europeans aren’t screaming for more firearms. 

4. Saying that an alternative to a violence pandemic isn’t desirable either so keep as much access to weapons that kill several hundred peoples within minutes (Vegas shooter for example - while I understand only 50 died (can’t believe in America we can actually refer to that as only) hundreds were injured and were literally just as able to be killed) is just illogical and stupid. Other countries just do not have this problem. Yes every country has some degree of gun violence and black market but the fact that we lead the western world in firearms per capita and have the most school shootings and mass shootings is just painfully obviously connected.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
804,"Proud Boys strife spills over

10 - 12 minutes

		 

Stalking case shows 'doxxing,' sketchy side of flag waves in outskirts of Portland as political tensions spread. 

?

PMG PHOTO: BRITTANY ALLEN - Dixie Bailey is a co-organizer of the pro-police group Sandy Backs the Blue. 

In a case that shows how Portland's political strife has spilled over into the city's outskirts, the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office has opened an investigation into Dixie Lea Bailey, a cigar store owner in Sandy and local ""patriot"" leader who's become aligned with Proud Boys activist Alan Swinney. 

And even as Swinney battles well-publicized criminal charges in Multnomah County for pointing a pistol at protesters and firing paint balls at them, his ally, Bailey, has been wrapped up in a lower profile civil case in a Clackamas courthouse. 

Bailey's case centers on a stalking petition accusing her of menacing and online harassment, including accusations that she pointed a gun at a liberal critic of hers. Bailey denies the allegations. 

The two cases appear to have become somewhat intertwined. Swinney's lawyer is part of Bailey's defense, and court records show Swinney had been staying at Bailey's house in Rhododendron near the base of Mount Hood before being jailed on Sept. 30. Bailey has raised funds for Swinney's defense. 

Last week, Swinney promised to stay with Bailey pending trial if let out of jail. But a judge denied his release after prosecutors cited social media posts by Swinney indicating he feels he is in a ""civil war"" and that ""violence is the appropriate response to the protests occurring in Portland."" 

Bailey's situation is significant because, while clashes at Portland protests have drawn the public's attention, the stalking case sheds light on a more subtle form of political strife that's played out online and in the outskirts of Portland. 

Bailey, who co-owns Mt. Hood Cigar Co. with her husband, is prone to social media posts with political commentary and images of herself firing guns. She has been a prominent leader in organizing conservative ""Sandy Backs the Blue"" demonstrations ostensibly meant to support the police. The demonstrations have been followed by similar ""flag wave"" actions in places like Estacada and Gresham. 

Political targeting alleged

In court, Bailey blamed the stalking case on Milone, the restaurant owner who filed the stalking petition against her, arguing that Milone's online posts alerting people to Bailey's affiliation with Swinney were ""just harassment and stalking."" 

Bailey's lawyer, Greg Oliveros, meanwhile, said she is being targeted because of her political beliefs and affiliation with Swinney — who reportedly wears a ""Proud Boys"" tattoo on his arm. 

""Assuming that (Bailey) might be a member of the Proud Boys, (Milone's lawyer) hasn't proven that that (affiliation) has made her more dangerous,"" Oliveros said at a recent hearing. ""There is an exhibit in this matter that shows (Bailey) with a machine gun, but that photograph doesn't suggest one way or the other that respondent is going to carry out and threaten a petitioner in any way."" 

Asked separately if Bailey is active with the Proud Boys, Oliveros told the Tribune, ""I don't know that."" He said Bailey had done nothing wrong. 

Both Milone and Bailey have set up fundraising accounts online. 

Conflict started online

Court records show that Milone had been posting about Bailey and her affiliation with Swinney, even noting Bailey's home address. 

Bailey testified that someone had been posting signs about her on her street, and a friend told her it might have been someone in a silver car – a silver car, Bailey told the judge, like the one she said she spotted in Milone's driveway on Aug. 25. 

Milone said that Bailey showed up at Milone's house that day, pointed a gun at her and also took her picture with a cell phone, while saying ""I got you, girl,"" and threatening to shoot her dogs. 

Bailey, in court, denied pointing her gun at Milone or threatening her, saying she'd kept her pistol in its holster on her right hip during the encounter. What she held along with her phone was a cigar, she said. Her husband, who was driving, later testified that Bailey held only a phone, not a cigar. 

What's not disputed is that Bailey immediately went home and posted Milone's photo and address on social media, calling Milone a ""local antifa member,"" a ""wicked witch,"" and accusing her of ""doxxing"" her — a term for posting private and identifying information about someone on the internet for the purpose of harassment — by sharing her home and business address. 

""It is time to shed light on these Antifa (expletive),"" Bailey wrote. 

""Hey hey! Ho Ho! Joylenne has got to go!!"" Bailey wrote in another post, misspelling Milone's first name. 

Antifa is loosely defined term for leftwing protesters, which comes from ""anti-fascist;"" it also sometimes refers to anarchists who use aggressive or violent tactics at protests known as ""black bloc."" 

Milone, in court, said that contrary to being an ""antifa"" member, she's never been to a protest in her entire life. 

Bailey testified that she just happened to see the silver car, and that the visit to MIlone's house was not planned. In court, Milone's lawyer quesitoned that. Online, when a supporter told Bailey the visit to Milone she posted online about was legal, she responded, ""I know. I spoke to the Clackamas County PD today before I made any plans."" 

Milone and a friend who stayed with her on the night of Aug. 25 claimed that Bailey later returned around midnight, driving by slowly while yelling, ""I got you girl."" 

The friend testified that when she arrived at Milone's house after Bailey left the first time, she found Milone ""visibly shaking"" in fear. 

Bailey, however, denied any subsequent in-person contact with Milone. The cigar store owner denied making threats and denied encouraging others to threaten Milone. 

Regardless, after Bailey posted online about Milone, threatening language about her began appearing online, and fake negative reviews of her restaurant, too. 

Milone, in hearings, complained that law enforcement hadn't done anything about her complaints, even failing to document all of her complaints about alleged harassment or menacing. 

""They said it was free speech,"" she complained to a judge. 

She also referred to a video circulating that purportedly shows Bailey using bear spray on a Black Lives Matter protester. 

The Clackamas Sheriff's office as well as the Clackamas District Attorney's office declined to comment on the case, saying it's part of a pending criminal investigation. 

The sheriff's office has been accused in recent weeks of being politically biased. A spokesman, Sgt. Marcus Mendoza, told the Portland Tribune that ""Our office investigates claims of alleged crimes without regard to political affiliations. The case you are referring to is an ongoing investigation in which the Sheriff's Office took statements from those involved and completed reports. We then submitted the reports to the District Attorney's Office to review our investigatory report, determine whether a crime occurred, and file criminal charges as warranted. "" 

Court ruling expected 

The civil stalking case has been making its way through Clackamas Circuit Court, and Judge Jeffrey S. Jones is expected to issue a ruling next month. 

To some observers, Milone's experience, including the flag wave held near her business, shows the questionable side of the flag waves and ""Back the Blue"" demonstrations. 

One video Bailey posted captures a person — apparently Bailey —telling Black Lives Matter counter-protesters, ""when police are abolished, you're going to have to deal with us."" The woman proceeds to say ""You're mine. Just know that ... I know who you are. I've got your facebook. I've got your information. You're mine."" 

Another video posted by Bailey shows flag-wave attendees voicing conspiracy theories that have been promoted by groups like Q-Anon. 

""Joe Biden's a pedo,"" the demonstrators shouted repeatedly at passing cars, referring to one such conspiracy theory. 

Recently, the leadership of Sandy Backs the Blue have sought to distance the group from aggressive or divisive political messages. 

Bailey is no longer part of that leadership. On Aug. 20, not long after the Sandy Post published an article about how Swinney and other Proud Boys had begun showing up at Sandy Backs the Blue events, Bailey posted a video saying she had formally relinquished her post heading Sandy Backs the Blue. 

""There's some things that I want to do that can't necessarily be involved with Backs the Blue,"" she said. 

Facebook posts by some of Bailey's supporters suggested they intended the flag waves as a way to punish business owners who had been vocal in their support of Black Lives Matter, or to recruit members into more aggressive ""patriot"" groups. 

Following Bailey's posts about Milone, some of Bailey's allies began organizing a flag-waving outside Milone's restaurant, Koya's Kitchen, in Welches, planning to set it for dinner time, Facebook posts show — apparently to hurt her business and annoy customers. That particular flag-wave did not happen. 

Some other business owners say they have faced similar campaigns. One of them, who'd vocally supported Black Lives Matter, showed up to testify in court, saying Bailey had harassed her and posted a photo of her own teenage daughter online. 

After Bailey posted Milone's address on Facebook in late August, Swinney chimed in, urging people to attend a flag-wave in Milone's ""little piece of America"" and accusing her of ""trying to ruin Trump supporters' lives."" 

He openly sought to use the action to recruit new members to his movement. 

""Let's keep this growing,"" he wrote. ""Help us build our numbers."" 

In a July post, he invited others to join him at a Sandy flag wave, saying ""My plan is to hit these little towns and recruit, then we all go into Portland together.""",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are a nation that made tv preachers millions, gun manufacturers rich bc somehow somewhere along the way of building this country we fell into a belief that Jesus is pro guns and is pro forcing people into their religion instead of actually practicing what’s in the damn book like turning the other cheek and loving one another. 

Religion is good and all but not when it allows for organizations like the WBC to exist, every church no matter denomination should be offended by their existence, the fucking hate they spew but they don’t, they simply don’t and would rather tell you how to live instead of actually allowing you to do whatever you want behind closed doors which is what America should be about.

Still waiting for him to round up all the black people and throw them in gulags like you guys said he would.

&gt;	Threat to the lives of people seeking asylum from violent homelands and persecution. After all we’re constantly pushing “America #1,” otherwise they wouldn’t come here.

Good. Come legally or fuck off.

&gt;	Threat to the lives of schoolchildren due to overall inaction on gun control.

Yeah I wish he would actually take action on gun control. I want to buy a minigun.

you seriously think guns are to blame for school shootings and not their unstable mental states brought on by shitty parenting/stress/social climates/etc.?

&gt;	Threat to our health (COVID failures).

Trump’s COVID response was incompetent at best, but acting like it’s solely or even mostly his fault is childish and idiotic, especially when democrats and the media kept downplaying COVID back when it was just starting, and he got labeled a racist for trying to shut down travel from China early on. 

&gt;	Threat to national security (pissing off our allies while praising authoritarians).

America’s too important as what is essentially the world’s police force for any of our allies to consider attacking us even if trump *had* seriously damaged international relations.

&gt;	Threat to the lives of protesters (fails to condemn far-right militias, violence, etc.).

The rioters have been far more dangerous thus far than any right wing “militia”.

Also, here’s Trump [condemning white supremacist groups multiple times](https://streamable.com/sr9o2s).

&gt;	Threat to the lives of minorities via hostile rhetoric, leading supporters to violent action

Such as what? Trump’s main voter base are the moderate republicans that are so afraid of being called racist that they’d stop supporting him if he ever actually said stuff like that. Aside from a few racist jokes/comments he made in the 70s, the only actually racist things he’s said were either made up or taken out of context.

God it’s hard to not sound like a full on MAGA person when talking about trump to redditors because of how unbelievably stupid most of your criticisms of him actually are.

&gt;	Threat to our democracy should he fail to accept the results of our election in the event that he loses.

lmao what would he do? Sit in his Oval Office chair with his arms crossed and refuse to get up?

You guys should know by now that he’s all bark and no bite. Just says whatever outrageous thing comes to his mind if it’ll get him front page news coverage for the next week.

&gt;	Don’t tell me all those things are false and are actually helping us, and that it’s just the leftist media trying to make our president look bad. Because overwhelmingly, trustworthy sources say these are all things he has done.

And I never said anything about teaching history dishonestly  honestly, I support the proper teaching of history, that doesn’t mean burn our flag. But I also don’t think what happened history should represent modern institutions, that’s why I don’t generally use the democrats owning slaves against them unless the left uses things republicans have done in the past against me. That’s why I don’t hate japan or Germany. Also what’s wrong with painting the left with a few extremist when the left thinks the police needs to be defunded because of a few unjust killings. The message of burning a flag isn’t we can do better, it’s anti American. If they wanted to better our country, they would actually propose a solution to the problems they think this country has, other than stereotype all police as racist and all whites as privileged. The KKK shrunk in size significantly after they switched to the Republican side, also what they do now is nothing compared to what leftist extremists do such as antifa. And yeah I will admit to most racist voting republican, but I will also admit to most anti Americans voting democratic. 10 rounds is not plenty for a magazine, maybe if you are hunting but not for any other purpose. You don’t realize how little the rounds is until you get into a shootout. Also it will hardly do anything for mass shootings. Most crimes are committed with an illegal or unregistered weapon, you know the kind the government can trace. And even if the buy back isn’t mandatory he still wants to stop people from buying new assault weapons, which is on the same level as banning them. You realize a gun chambered in the same caliber and also semi automatic but doesn’t have a pistol grip isn’t considered an assault weapon. They are just as affective at killing as an assault weapon. Also most gun violence is done with pistols, he just wants to ban assault weapons because they look scary. Trump may lie, but he doesn’t attack the media for telling the truth, he attacks them for their constant blatant lies. Attacking illegal immigration isn’t to snag racist, it’s to snag people that support this country who don’t want thugs crossing the border illegally. America does have an illegal immigration problem, estimates can range from 10 - 15 million of illegals in this country. The proud boys aren’t white supremacists, they even denounced it. There are videos of them kicking out white supremacists and neo nazis out of Trump rally’s. Personally I don’t know much about the proud boys, but most things I’ve seen of them aren’t white supremacists. You keep comparing Hitler to Trump when I ask the question of how would a right wing dictator come to power in America. News flash, Hitler wasn’t American, and Trump isn’t a dictator. So this doesn’t answer my question. Maybe I should clarify, what policies would a dictator pass to actually make him a dictator in America while keeping support of the right. I don’t really feel like buying a book or studying Marxism myself, but I’d be willing to read a summary of Marxism from you or an article you recommend.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
821,"Yea, fuck that guy. Seriously. 

I’d argue the difference is I was presenting my actual reasons that brought me to my stance. As an example.... I think school shootings could be curbed by allowing armed individuals in schools. We protect our banks, politicians, military bases, and even most malls.... we can certainly protect our children. And as COVID has shown... kids don’t scare easy. I think they would be fine with an armed guard or specifically trained concealed carry staff. These same kids don’t freak out when they see security guards everywhere. Inner city schools have largely handled the gun violence in schools issue long ago. 

I have kids. My wife teaches. I want them safe. I worry about it all the time. But opinion was dismissed as “evil” because I “value guns more than children”, like I’m a cartoon villain. Despite just telling her I value firearms *because* of my children. I want my kids protected like we protect our politicians. 

I completely get we see extremes on both sides though. No disagreement, brother. I think I did bad job making my point that some people just don’t want to have actual discussion... on both sides. Open discourse is never a bad thing. I can disagree with someone but appreciate why they believe in something. America needs more of that right now, and less “Nazi! Commie!” rhetoric.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

823,"We Must Save Democracy From Conspiracies  By Sacha Baron Cohen
October 8, 2020 : https://time.com/5897501/conspiracy-theory-misinformation/

&gt;A few times in my career, I have genuinely feared for my life.

&gt;In Arkansas, I posed as an ultimate fighter at a cage match and challenged anyone in the audience to take me on. When my fake ex-boyfriend volunteered, we engaged in some heavy petting, triggering a near riot. The crowd—including some recently paroled prisoners with swastika tattoos—erupted in homophobic slurs and started hurling metal chairs at us. Had I not ducked into a trapdoor and out an escape tunnel, I think the crowd would have beaten me senseless.

&gt;Moments like that are frightening. Today, though, I’m truly terrified—for the survival of democracy itself.

&gt;A year ago, I spoke out publicly for the first time in my own voice because I feared that our pluralistic democracies were at risk of being destroyed by a flood of hate, lies and conspiracies spewed by demagogues and spread by social media. Since then, this toxic brew has exploded into the open and—with just weeks until the election—these conspiracies threaten to kill democracy as we know it.

&gt;For most of my career, I’ve been reluctant to take a public stance on the issues of the day. I’ve felt more comfortable in character—or in a mankini. Yes, a lot of my comedy is uncomfortably pubescent. But when it works, satire can humble the powerful and expose the ills of society. As Abbie Hoffman, who helped lead the 1968 protests against the Vietnam War during the Democratic convention in Chicago, liked to say, “Sacred cows make the tastiest hamburger.” By getting people to reveal what they really believe, I have at times exposed the ignorance, bigotry and conspiratorial delusions that often lurk just below the surface of our modern lives.

&gt;Using unhinged lies and conspiracies to gain power and subjugate others is, of course, nothing new. The blood libel—the myth that Jews murdered Christian children and used their blood for religious rituals—is the world’s oldest conspiracy, dating back to the Middle Ages. The lie that Black people are genetically inferior or inherently violent is at the core of white supremacy. The lie that women are biologically or mentally unequal to men—to be treated as property and body-shamed—has perpetuated millennia of patriarchy. The lie that there is an epidemic in the U.S. of babies being executed shortly after birth has helped fuel state bans on abortion, even in the case of rape or incest.

&gt;Today, however, is a uniquely dangerous moment. Donald Trump—who averages 23 lies a day and is the world’s greatest superspreader of coronavirus conspiracies—has caught the virus himself. He has a dutiful ally in Facebook—the greatest propaganda machine in history. And this is a time when Americans are especially vulnerable to lies and conspiracies. This trifecta has created a whirlwind of conspiratorial madness.

&gt;First, trailing in the polls, Trump clearly believes that his only hope for political survival is to spin an alternate universe: Beijing deliberately spread the “Chinese virus,” we’re told, “Don’t be afraid of Covid,” and the election is “rigged” unless states “get rid of” mail-in ballots. It’s as if we’re in the final days of the Age of Reason—the Enlightenment-induced commitment to evidence, science and objective fact. “Truth isn’t truth,” the President’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said, and facts are “in the eye of the beholder.” We are told, without any sense of Orwellian irony, to deny the very existence of our external reality.

&gt;Second, the Demagogue in Chief has a willing accomplice in Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook—a megaphone that history’s worst autocrats could only dream of. Its algorithm deliberately amplifies content that generates more engagement—and as one unnamed Facebook executive recently told Politico, “Right-wing populism is always more engaging” because it triggers “anger, fear” and “an incredibly strong, primitive emotion.” Not surprisingly, most days the top 10 Facebook posts are overwhelmingly from right-wing pundits and outlets.

&gt;Facebook largely refuses to fact-check political ads and posts—which it then microtargets to voters. And Facebook still hasn’t taken down Trump’s “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Astonishingly, Facebook continues to give a platform to white supremacists and Holocaust deniers. It’s as if the satirist Jonathan Swift foresaw the awful power of social media when he said, “Falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it.”

&gt;Third, all these lies couldn’t come at a worse time. Studies show that people are especially susceptible to conspiracies in periods of great uncertainty when they feel a loss of control over their lives and want answers to make sense of the world. Over the years, I’ve filmed people, who otherwise seemed to be good and decent, repeating lethal conspiracies—regurgitating the diet of lies that they have been fed hourly on social media.

&gt;In recent months, millions of people viewed a conspiracy video claiming that face masks can cause coronavirus before Facebook and YouTube eventually took it down. On Oct. 6, Facebook finally banned QAnon—the bonkers conspiracy theory that Trump is battling a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles (mostly Democrats and celebrities) who drink the blood of children, an unmistakable echo of anti-Semitic blood libel—but not before pushing it to millions of Americans and people around the world. The shared reality upon which democracy depends has been shredded.

&gt;It would all be hilarious if it weren’t so dangerous. In his famous experiment in the 1960s, the Yale psychology professor Stanley Milgram found that when instructed to do so by a perceived authority figure, most people complied and administered what they believed were dangerous electric shocks to a person in the next room, even as they heard the “victim” (an actor) scream in pain. On my show Who Is America?, I convinced a man who believed Trump’s conspiracies to visit a women’s march in San Francisco and push a button that I told him would kill a person who he thought was an “antifa terrorist.”

&gt;For his supporters, Trump is the authority figure whose cues they will follow. With his history of inciting violence and emboldening militias and white-supremacist groups and dozens of cases where his supporters have attacked innocent people in his name, we’d have to be the real fools not to see the perils ahead. The violent clashes between Trump supporters and protesters in Portland, Ore., were a preview of how a contentious election could spiral into violence.

&gt;Conspiracies are lethal—to our health and to our democracy—and Election Day is now only weeks away. Even as Trump is being treated for COVID-19, he continues to rage-tweet lies and conspiracy theories so fast, it’s virtually impossible to correct them all. Although it removed one misleading Trump post about coronavirus on Oct. 5, Facebook has repeatedly failed to block other disinformation and refuses to implement systemic reforms advocated by the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, of which I am a part.

&gt;The fate of U.S. democracy now rests with voters and whether they stand up in record numbers and choose truth over lies. As protesters outside the 1968 Democratic convention chanted after they were brutally beaten by police, “The whole world is watching”—and this time it’s to see whether our planet’s oldest democracy will endure or slide into autocracy.

&gt;While filming my latest Borat film, I showed up as a right-wing singer at a gun-rights rally in Washington State. When organizers finally stormed the stage, I rushed to a nearby get-away vehicle. An angry crowd blocked our way and started pounding on the vehicle with their fists. Under my overalls, I was wearing a bulletproof vest, but it felt inadequate with some people outside toting semiautomatic weapons. When someone ripped open the door to drag me out, I used my entire body weight to pull the door back shut until our vehicle maneuvered free.

&gt;I was fortunate to make it out in one piece. The next few weeks will determine whether America will be so lucky.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

825," 

It has been one year since authorities in Mexico released Sinaloa Cartel scion Ovidio Guzmán to stop his gunmen from laying waste to Culiacán, and now a block party — replete with music, beer, raffles and a parade — is allegedly in the works to celebrate. 

A [post on social media](https://www.facebook.com/Elnotiejido/posts/3274661779317636) inviting people to “Ovidio Fest” has been shared thousands of times and received hundreds of comments. The party — set to be held October 17 — is a self-described celebration of the “rescue” of Ovidio, one of the sons of convicted Sinaloa Cartel capo Joaquín Guzmán Loera, [alias “El Chapo.”](https://www.insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/joaquin-guzman-loera-el-chapo/)

The [capture and subsequent release](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/el-chapo-son-detained-freed-after-cartel-mobilization-mexico/) of Ovidio — an [enormous embarrassment](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/culiacan-shambles-security-plan-mexico/) for the government — occurred after heavily-armed cartel henchmen laid siege to Culiacán on October 17, 2019. Gun battles erupted on the streets. Smoke billowed from the husks of vehicles set ablaze. The gunmen held the city hostage for several hours until government forces — outnumbered and outgunned — were ordered to free him.

**SEE ALSO:** [Son of ‘El Chapo’ Freed After Fierce Cartel Mobilization in Mexico](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/el-chapo-son-detained-freed-after-cartel-mobilization-mexico/)

The Facebook post invites Culiacán’s residents to celebrate at the Desarrollo Urbano Tres Ríos business district, with festivities kicking off at 5 p.m.  There will be “live music, food, wine, beer,” in addition to raffles, surprise gifts and contests, as well as a parade, the post reads. 

According to [local media reports](https://radioformulaculiacan.com/investigara-alcalde-de-culiacan-veracidad-de-invitacion-a-ovidio-fest/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=investigara-alcalde-de-culiacan-veracidad-de-invitacion-a-ovidio-fest), Culiacán Mayor Jesús Estrada Ferreiro was unaware the invitation was being circulated but said he would look into the matter.

### InSight Crime Analysis

While it remains to be seen if the party will happen, the event alone speaks to how the sons of El Chapo, known collectively as[ Los Chapitos](https://www.insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/los-chapitos/), are benefiting from their father’s quasi-mythical reputation.

The Guzmán family legacy is built on El Chapo’s [rags-to-riches](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mexico-elchapo-sinaloa/even-behind-bars-el-chapos-robin-hood-luster-glows-in-mexico-drug-capital-idUSKCN1PO2CQ) origin story. El Chapo was born into a poor family in the rural community of La Tuna in Sinaloa state. He got his start in the drug trade [when he and his](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35271257) cousins cultivated marijuana as teenagers.

There is a long cultural, historical and social context regarding drug trafficking in Sinaloa. For decades, security forces have violently cracked down on communities suspected of being involved in smuggling. As a result, locals have, at times, expressed affinity toward those who have been able to outwit authorities and protect what is for many their main source of livelihood.

Like drug traffickers before him, El Chapo gained local support by using the cartel’s wealth to allegedly [develop infrastructure](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35271257) projects, provide [medical assistance](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/05/mexico-war-on-drugs-hidden-story-joaquin-guzman-war-us) and [make other contributions](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/la-fg-archive-mythology-of-joaquin-el-chapo-guzman-20081103-story.html) to his home state. 

His legend only grew with two movie-like prison escapes: [first](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/cuando-el-chapo-escapo-del-penal-de-puente-grande-en-un-carrito-de-lavanderia) in a laundry cart in 2001 and then [through](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/el-chapo-s-2nd-escape-could-paralyze-mexico-s-already-reeling-security-strategy/) an underground tunnel on a motorcycle in 2015.

While the head of the Sinaloa Cartel, he became the world’s most notorious drug trafficker, only rivaled by former Medellín Cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar. 

Narcocorridos [celebrated](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/6627362/el-chapo-guzman-narcocorridos-songs) his exploits, and he garnered popular interest in and out of Mexico. He even graced Forbes’ [exclusive list](https://www.forbes.com/profile/joaquin-guzman-loera/#c78e05e67785) of the world’s billionaires for a time.

Numerous profiles have been written about him, and his life story is the subject of a Netflix series, “[El Chapo](https://www.netflix.com/co/title/80133042).”

**SEE ALSO:** [Mexico News and Profiles](https://www.insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/)

Since he was imprisoned [for life](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/is-mexico-better-el-chapo-jail-life/) in the United States in 2019, his family has tried to preserve his Robin Hood persona by handing out [pandemic assistance packages](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/mexico-cartels-hand-out-food-coronavirus-pandemic/), which were stamped with his face and name. His wife also released a [clothing line](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/narco-bling-el-chapos-wife-opens-fashion-line/) in his styling.

Though El Chapo has become intertwined in popular culture, his ruthlessness as leader of one of the world’s most notorious transnational crime groups must not be overlooked. He either directly participated in or ordered the torture and murder of [dozens of people](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/nyregion/el-chapo-trial-murders.html), as was described in his [highly publicized trial](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/us-el-chapo-guilty-mexico-drug-war-wages/).

Since their father’s capture, Ovidio and two of his brothers, Iván and Jésus, have seen their profiles raised in the cartel, and there have been reports [they are battling](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/conflict-sinaloa-cartel-spike-western-mexico-violence/) the cartel’s old guard for power. They have also left their own trail of bloodshed, with their men reportedly involved [in a shootout](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/estados/sinaloa-enfrentamientos-en-tepuche-dejan-16-muertos) that left 16 people dead in Culiacán and the [execution](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/mexico-chino-antrax-sinaloa/) of a former ally. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Justice Department [allege](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/us-authorities-target-los-chapitos-sinaloa/) that they have continued their father’s drug trafficking empire.

The block party celebrating Ovidio’s release falls in a familiar vein — toasting Guzmán’s brazen escape and burnishing the family legacy while disregarding the damage wrought.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

827,"    National Civil Rights movement

Movement? Their goals are ""End the War on Black People"", a goal that is lofty and mercurial and is an answer chasing a question, which leads to the primary goals.

&amp;#x200B;

* Economic justice (a lofty and mercurial ""goal"" to get infinite handouts)
* Reparations
* Invest-Divest (see part one plus terrorizing the working class again with denial of effective law enforcement service, while the rich hide in gated communities)
* Community Control (something long been stated as a ""goal"" for civil rights activists, but has never been followed through when they get the opp. Just like the drive for black police officers after the Rodney King riots)
* Political Power (nobody has political power in America unless you're a rich neoliberal, this is blatantly not a race thing)

All things that will near-universally be paid for by poor working whites and other minorities, robbing peter to pay paul. Because theres no way the fed will dip into its MMT funny money to increase the living standards of the poor, it'd be much more effective politically to divide them by taxing everyone else whos poor more to give money to the people dividing their (poor) class up into racial groups and make them rob each other.

    I think the one thing I heard about any violence was from a right winger pulling a gun on people

Ive seen the entire video, banging on someone's vehicle with fists and objects as well as blocking it because he flipped you off isnt a smart move in a stand your ground state.

    Also if you think voting for a fucking billionaire (and a shitty one at that) is voting for the interests of the middle class you're delusional.

I dont think that, but I can understand why people do. Because the fucking billionaire at least \*pretends\* to not hate white people and pretends to not place them in hostile conditions in every aspect of life, and doesn't pretend antifa isn't an organization with people who run chapters with names and addresses[https://torchantifa.org/chapters/](https://torchantifa.org/chapters/)

Thats not even to get into his campaigns populist issue to bring manufacturing back, hes never going to do it, but you wont hear humdingers like ""Those jobs are never coming back"" out of Trumps mouth like you will Neolibs in the DNC like Obama did in 2016.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
828,"&gt;The problem with Democrats and gun control is that their specific proposals are bad. Take banning AR-15s (or ""assault rifles"" if you want). AR-15s are used in an extreme minority of gun crime, and yet are the most popular sporting rifle in the country and most inline with the intention of the 2nd amendment. There is no reasonable case for banning them given the 2nd amendment.

I would agree that long guns are not as much a problem with regards to crime as handguns. But again, nobody has proposed outright banning them. Beto O'Rourke is the only one I heard mention banning AR-15s, and that may have have been just an emotional off the cuff statement rather than an intended policy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also take the terror watch list Obama mentioned. What Obama and other Democrats are arguing for is allowing the government to unilaterally, without any oversight or way to appeal, take away the constitutional rights of US citizens. If you don't like the 2nd amendment, fine, but try to understand how insane that would be if it was this was the 1st amendment, or abortion rights we were talking about here.

If someone is a terrorist and it's at the point that they are on a no-fly list and can't even catch an airplane for fear that they will hijack it, under what logic do you think such a person should be able to purchase firearms?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Regarding his question, it was poorly worded too. It should have been ""why do you support gun control that would disproportionately affect responsible gun owners while doing little to nothing to reduce gun violence?""

How do you think guns make it into the hands of criminals? First off not all murders are from ""thugs"" wandering the streets. Most murders are acquaintance murders. 80% of homicides are between people who know each other. 17% are between people who are related. People getting in heated disputes. Road rage. Domestic violence. The largest slice of the gun death pie, 2/3rds is suicides. How do guns fall into the hands of the wrong people? Afterall the gun manufactures aren't selling them direct to the black market. They are bought by ""responsible"" gun owners. Those guns are eventually sold to others, given away, borrowed, stolen and end up in the pipeline to the black market. Every gun in the hand of a thug was once owned by a legal purchaser. They don't always stay with the good guys. Ultimately legal gun owners are the pipeline to illegal gun owners. Unfortunately though, the pandoras box has been open so long that it may be simply impossible to control. Any country around the world thinking of loosing their gun restrictions should use America as a cautionary tale. That once that cat is out of the bag and your nation is flooded with weapons, you will end up with a huge black market that will make a homicide problem that is difficult to control. There are many countries around the world where parents send their kids to school and give no thought of them getting shot while in the classroom.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
829,"America is in an internal arms race and it's not a good thing. With that said, I understand why individuals make the decision to arm themselves, especially if they have good reason to feel vulnerable to violence. Just in the aggregate, I think gun culture has not served the country well.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
830,"&gt;Why does the US have one of the highest crime rates in the developed world then?

Poverty in inner cities in black neighborhoods. The fact that half of all violent crime in America is committed by less than 10% of its population should tell you most of what you need to know. 

&gt;We put 5x as many people in prison as other places,

Because it is profitable to do so. We pay companies to keep prisoners in jail, house them, feed them, clothe them, and protect them. We also can get slave labor from every prisoner.

Other countries have to pay for their prisoners directly through tax money to state and federal prisons. And also dont do slavery.

&gt;have more guns than people,

Nothing necessarily wrong with that.

&gt;and our police are at liberty to take just about any measures they see as necessary,

Yes, which is a huge problem, and you're right, some of that is due to gun proliferation because the police can reasonably expect that anyone they are talking to might have a gun.

&gt;what is missing? More guns?

Well, the problem is, we cant do less guns now. The cat is out of the bag. The guns that are out there are out there and they arent coming back. Especially the ones you have to worry about, the criminal ones criminals have. Even if you passed a law and every law abiding citizen turned in their guns, gun crime would change very little.

So, we need to work on the issues with gun violence from within that framework. So what can we do? Well, we can start by targeting/punishing the people who are allowed to buy guns who buy guns legally and then deliberately sell them illegally to people who arent allowed to buy them, known as straw purchasers. This is how illegal guns end up in criminal hands, that and theft.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
831,"The thing is this dictators are not bloodthirsty for fun the primary reason is that the killing of people serves a purpose. If you read the Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli you can see how violence can serve a political end. The first and most common examples of dictator doing ""bloodthirsty things"" is the purging that follows their rise to power Stalin's Great Purge or Hitler's the Night of the Long Knives in which many Soviet and Nazi officials were killed now why was this carried out because it consolidate power under themselves reducing threats to their own power and it removed unnecessary weight on the system. The system I am referring to here is the system of how you maintain power is you need people to support you namely those in important positions and how do you get support by rewarding them for being loyal so if someone is no longer important to holding power but still getting rewards they should be removed because they are unnecessary and a potential risk. Now they will also tend to have others that will stay in power get their hands dirty and help with this purge as to create fear among that class if they can trust one another in opposing the dictator creating a barrier to resistance. Now that is why they violence as way to maintain control of those at the top but now why do they use violence on every day people you may ask? To that we should look to Saddam Hussein who emulated and learned from both Stalin and Hitler it is two main party one that treating the citizenry bad does not effect his ability to make money and reward his followers negatively so he had no incentive to treat them well and stealing from them makes it easier to reward followers and the second reason is to keep revolution from happening. Now that might sound odd as the worse conditions you would think the more likely revolution is but no as revolutions takes time to grow and the constant crack downs break that up and the fear they cause discourage attempts and the worse off their lives the less effective they would be if they did rebel as starving men with sticks are not a threat. Due to censorship that these dictators but in place it is hard to organize against them and that makes it even harder for regular citizens to rebel as they can't all do it at once in an organized way that say we can in America when we do protests across the country at the same time. Now the final and one that is the hardest to easily grasps it use to them is genocide but that serves a purpose as well as it is part of the scapegoating that they do in order to make people put up with them they most seem like they are dealing with some threat to the nation now sometimes that is complete external like America for North Korea which does not lead to genocide but when it is an internal threat like the Armenians were in the Ottoman Empire genocide happens as they were shifting blame for losing world war one to the Armenians being traitors as the dictator never takes responsibility for failure as that would lead to his own fall so someone must be they an official below them, a group of people or a foreign entity but someone must and a minority not well liked already is an easy pick. When Pol Pot killed the educated who he scapegoated for Cambodia problems it serves to purposes making it look like he was doing what he promised to save Cambodia but  also removed threats of people smart enough to be effective in opposing him which is why the smart and their killed or re-educate as we see in China. Edgy teens don't have a real purpose to the edginess but dictators have a reason for the violence it serves an end to keep them in power. The reason Kim Jung Un his uncle with an anti-aircraft gun wasn't because oh he really didn't like his uncle but the fear it causes keeps him in power the message is clear anyone who is disloyal will die. This kind of thinking is sociopathic in all honesty but it is effective and edgy teens aren't sociopaths they are stupid kids acting out trying to get attention, to seem cool and find themselves but these dictators only want power and violence is a means to that end blood and fear are powerful tools if used correctly.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
832,"So I was downvoted pretty heavily for my original comment and I think a lot of those downvotes were also from people who were thinking what you're thinking in your reply.

But I need to be clear: in my post, I'm strictly talking about America is to Europe, not what America is to itself. Everything you're saying is true, and I recognise all of that. I often argue those same points myself. 

But from the perspective of a European looking to migrate to America? For all the country's flaws, it used to be a SUPER attractive option. And I wish it still was. That's the thing. I love America. I might've already moved there if it was a sensible choice to make, but these days it just isn't. I'm not necessarily in love with the Netherlands but the advantages of living here over living in America are too many for me to decide otherwise.

I just wish that wasn't the case. A lot of Europeans do. But why would we move to a country where we have to pay out the ass for health care, have to be worried about gun violence in schools, have to live in a democracy that's provably less functional than ours, etc etc. It's just a shitty time for the US right now. I hope you guys pull out of it, I really do, but some of that will require well intentioned people from outside the country joining in for that conversation. That outside perspective can help.

I also know that sometimes it involves saying shit that just sucks to hear, especially to a people who have told themselves for decades that their country is a shining city on a hill, who chant their country's name in everything from sports to politics, who sing their anthem at every opportunity they can, and recite the pledge of allegiance in their schools. All of those things help to contribute to a culture that brooks no dissent. And I'm the self-absorbed European who thinks he can just tell everyone how to live. Yeah I get it. I'll take the downvotes, I don't care. If the conversation keeps being had, eventually things will get better.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
833,"I told this story before.

I'm white. I grew up in a fairly ""Black"" neighborhood in one of the most segregated cities in America. All in all it was pretty cool and I never had any problems. I was friends with people of all sorts of different races. Still am. We were more united by our families economic situation than we ever were separated by color. But that's not to say everything was great. 

By the time I got to high school the neighborhood was in a pretty sharp decline and most people considered it one of the worst parts of town. One day I got on a bus to go over to my friends house. In the very back were a group of straight up gangster dudes. I grew up here so I knew what they were about. I also knew that being a white dude who looked like a typical skate punk I was pretty much a target. These guys were smoking and joking and cutting up and generally being rowdy. Everyone on the bus were obviously intimidated. You knew people were scared when dudes smoked on the bus and nobody said anything. Including the driver. I took a seat right behind the rear door. And just tried to pretend I didn't exist. After about 10 minutes the bell to stop the bus rang and one of the gangster dudes got up and all of his buddies were laughing. He kept saying ""should I?"" ""I'm gonna'"" and stuff like that. I knew something was going to go down so I casually raised my arm to block my face because I figured I was going to be sucker punched by the dude as he got off. Maybe I was. Who knows? But instead of sucker punching me in the face he put his lit cigarette out on my arm. Like pushed it in real far. I still have a scar. When he jumped off all his friends just cracked up. Like it was the funniest thing they ever saw. And everyone else on the bus just stared at me. or pretended like nothing happened. Even the bus driver gave me a look through the rearview mirror like ""Sorry white boy. You ain't worth me saying anything"". 

Meanwhile I'm sitting there wondering what I should do. Part of me wanted to jump off the bus and chase that punk-ass bitch down and kick his ass. Which I probably could have. But then I figured his friends would almost certainly jump off after me. And I'd get a serious beat down. Hell, this was the late 80s and gun violence was at an all time high; especially in my neighborhood. The odds are pretty good I would have been shot. Anyway, I ended up riding the bus a few more blocks, got off and walked home. I never told anyone what happened. Not my friends, not my parents. I was too confused and a little ashamed.

Now I won't ever say that the reason those dudes did me like that was because they were black. Because that's dumb. But I'll definitely say that they did it to me because I was white. 

Oh, and the craziest part? We literally drove right past a police station right before this happened. Yep, that's the kind of neighborhood it was. Dudes will burn a cigarette on some kid in broad daylight less than a block from a police station and no one will do shit to stop it. Or even acknowledge that it happened.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
834,"I pretty much agree with you. I actually think you bring up an excellent point about the right and gun culture. I think a left leaning 2nd Amendment could rob the right on their monopoly with this issue and might actually foster a rational discussion about guns in America. I think liberals dismiss gun nuts as crazy, but I think it would be more accurate to say that right wingers are crazy. I mean, you look at the a number of issues, the problem isn't the issue, it is American Conservatism's take on the issue.

I only disagree with you on the threat that the right wing gun nuts actually pose. Frankly, I think most, certainly the most vocal, are cowards. As a former US Army soldier, I have never really met a right wing gun nut (and by that I mean the fanatics) which I think is capable of doing anything difficult. I know this is dismissive, but most of these people couldn't even pass height/weight or an Army PT test. Most of these people seem to be military drop outs or wannabes. I could be wrong, but I am not overly concerned about a civil war. I certainly think there will be violence though and some innocent people are going to get killed.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My point wasnt to say that these are statistical problems,  but that people are still able to commit violence without guns, and mass violence in particular is no more difficult. If for some reason there wasnt a single gun in america, I highly doubt wede have a single less violent death. School shooters and terrorists would just use bombs. Gang members would just use knives or other weapons (good luck getting the guns away from the gangs in the first place tho). People who wanted to off themselves would just use meds or a high ledge (been there personally, guns do not make it easier).

Or were you unaware that the vast majority of gun deaths in america were either suicides listed as shootings, or gang violence? 

You know what is becoming a more and more frequent issue tho? Political violence. Particularly from the right. As in there are fare right mobs and militias roaming around jumping and intimidating people and occasionally just gunning them down I  the street. And it's only gonna escalate.

838,"For those unfamiliar with firearms it can be hard to conceive of legitimate uses for them, but in America firearms are used responsibly by law abiding citizens for legitimate purposes within the confines of the law. Thise reasons include, but are not limited to the following:

* **Police Have no Legal Duty to Protect You**

The job of law enforcement is to enforce laws, as they see fit. Multiple cases, up to the Supreme Court, have established that law enforcement has no duty to protect you.

[Warren v DC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia)

[Castle Rock v Gonzalez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales)

[DeShaney v Winnebago County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeShaney_v._Winnebago_County)

[Lozito v NY](http://decisions.courts.state.ny.us/fcas/fcas_docs/2013JUL/3001010882012002SCIV.pdf)

[And most recently in the Parkland shooting.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/12/19/parkland-shooting-judge-school-cops-no-duty-protect-kids/2360683002/)

The whole to *""protect and serve""* [is just a slogan that came from a PR campaign](http://www.lapdonline.org/history_of_the_lapd/content_basic_view/1128).

* **If Police do Come When Called the Average  Response Time is 11 to 18 Minutes but can be up to 24 Hours**

[While the average police response time in America is 11 minutes it can take as long as 1 to 24 hours if they respond at all.](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus/current/cv08107.pdf)

[According to the National Sheriff's Association this average response time is longer at 18 minuets.](https://www.sheriffs.org/content/embracing-technology-decrease-law-enforcement-response-time)

And we've had recent events such as the [national 911 outage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/09/fcc-to-investigate-nationwide-911-outage/) Which can keep emergency services from even receiving your call for help.

* **Gun are Used Defensively by American Citizens Everyday**

Due to its nature figures on defensive gun use are hard to nail down. Typically when a firearm is used defensively no one is hurt and rarely is anyone killed. Often times simply showing you are armed is enough to end a crime in  progress. Looking at the numbers even the [Violence Policy Center](http://www.vpc.org/studies/justifiable19.pdf), a gun control advocacy group, reports 177,330 instances of self defense against a violent crime with a firearm between 2014 and 2016. This translates to 56,110 violent crimes prevented annually on the low scale. This also doesn't include property crimes which include home burglaries which increase that number to over 300,000 defensive gun uses between 2014 to 2016 or over 100,000 annually.

This ranges upwards to 500k to 3 million according to the [CDC Report Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3). 

Government agencies from the CDC, BJS, and FBI have found:

[""Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals..."" &amp; "" Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns, i.e., incidents in which a gun was “used” by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender, have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies...""](http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3).

[""A fifth of the victims defending themselves with a firearm suffered an injury, compared to almost half of those who defended themselves with weapons other than a firearm or who had no weapon.""](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/ascii/hvfsdaft.txt)

[According to the BJS from 2007-11 there were 235,700 violent crime victimizations where the victim used a firearm to defend themselves against their assailant.](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf)

[The FBI Active Shooter Report for 2016 to 2017 specifically calls out multiple times an armed civilian stopped an Active Shooter.](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-incidents-us-2016-2017.pdf/view)

Also while defensive gun use is common less than 0.4% of those uses result in a fatality.

* **Guns are Used to Defend People, Pets, and Livestock Against Dangerous Fauna**

In rural, and even urban communities, firearms are used to defend People, Pets, and Livestock from all manner of dangerous and invasive species ranging from feral dogs, coyotes, Bob cats, mountain lions, bears, and rabid animals.

[According to the USDA over 200,000 cattle are lost to predators in America each year costing farmers and ranchers nearly 100 million dollars annually.](http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/CattDeath/CattDeath-05-12-2011.pdf) 

[Feral Hogs have been identified by the USDA as: ""a dangerous, destructive, invasive species"". 
Their impact includes ""$1.5 billion each year in damages and control costs... &amp; ...threatening the health of people, wildlife, pets, and other domestic animals"".](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/wildlifedamage/operational-activities/feral-swine)

[""Hunting continues to be the most effective, cost efficient and socially acceptable method of population control.""](http://congressionalsportsmen.org/policies/state/white-tailed-deer-management)

[""Natural predators as well as hunters play a role in keep deer populations at or below carrying capacity of the land.""](https://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/habitats/southtx_plain/habitat_management/gun.phtml)

[""The effective use of the legal hunting season is the best way to control deer populations.""](https://extension.illinois.edu/deer/damage.cfm?SubCat=8890)

[The US Fish and Wildlife Service even employs full time hunters to control populations like those of feral Hogs.](https://www.fws.gov/southeast/articles/hunting-the-wild-hog/)

* **Hunting Provides a Cheap Source of Meat for Low Income Families Especially in Rural Communities.**

Hunting is crucial for America's rural poor providing a renewable source of Meat for a low initial investment cost while providing a revenue source from wealthier hunters.

[Alaska Even has a great example of modern subsistence hunting.](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=subsistence.hunting)

* **Firearms are Used for Sporting and Hobby Purposes the World up to the Olympic Level.**

Sport and Hobby shooting is fun and a useful skill found throughout the world. This includes multiple Olympic shooting events.

[Shooting Events at the Summer Olympics.](https://www.olympic.org/shooting)

* **Death of Citizens at the hands of their own governments in the 20th Century**

[Oppressive regimes through out the world, including major European nations, were responsible for the deaths of over 200 million of their own citizens in the 20th Century alone.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide)

Including major European and East Asian nations. An armed populous provides a significant layer of defense against oppressive regimes abusing their populous.

These are just some of the many legitimate reasons for a law abiding citizen to own firearms. Besides these there are many more not mentioned here but these remain the core reasons modern Americans own firearms.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
839,"I'm not shy about the fact that I whole heartedly believe we are on the brink of civil war, but civil war and revolution aren't mutually exclusive.

I believe revolution is required to stop climate change and our descent into authoritarianism. But no one HAS to die. I want us to improve our society, strengthen our communities, and building a better future for the human race, and I wouldn't never take pleasure in hurting someone even if they opposed such wholesome things. 

It's fucking SAD our education system has failed these people. I grew up in the south and we aren't dealing with ""bad"" or ""stupid"" people. We're dealing with incredibly IGNORANT people. And not just ignorant because they didn't go to school, but ignorant of how a functioning society could work. 

They hate Obamacare because if you were like me at 20 trying to start a small business in Texas it WAS a step back! Obamacare took away affordable healthcare options for me.....but it wasn't the federal govt that did it, it was the state of Texas that refused Federal funding, not Obama who hurt me.

But uneducated and biased by family and community did I know that? Fuck no! I just thought Obama screwed me over! 

As an athiest alt leftist who grew up conservative Christian I don't think one side killing the other is going to solve anything, a revolution is not a genocide, there's nothing revolutionary about killing people who can't see eye to eye with you, we humans have been doing that since the neanderthals. People can change, and it's much easier to kill than it is to change someone's mind, but when you change a mind you gain an ally rather than taking a life. 

The real enemy is the 1%, not our uneducated neighbors. We need to try to find a way educate people, not kill them. Donald Trump's been a great divider to stir up problems amongst ourselves and distract us from the problems we share. 

Whether or not this guy ""deserved"" to get shot this is fucking sad. We have more gun violence in this country  in a week than most western countries do in a year, and one thing the right wing is correct about is it isn't the guns. Guns don't kill people, angry, uneducated people who are desperate kill people. If we had a society that gave a shit about people's wellness and quality of life we could avoid 95% of the shit plaguing America...",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
840,"&gt; You know, they didn't start doing that till people started fireboming, burning shit and throwing bricks at cops. Honestly, MAYBE it's better to NOT be near that group and maybe, don't protest near the cops... have a sign and stand on a corner and do your chant and don't go near the officers, when some idiots want to be violent

Even if that were true (it’s not, the police used violent tactics from the start) that’s guilt by association. Saying some members of one protest did violent things is not a justification to tear gas a bunch of people standing there in the streets, protesting in a manner which they are constitutionally protected in doing. 

&gt; Even in your evidence, you have what, one person was killed by an officer and it was an accident, they couldn't have possibly known she had a per-existing condition, but the protestors have also KILLED innocent people

Okay so maybe using tear gas, which breaks up crowds because its effects are basically torture on a good day, is kinda barbaric and it is obvious that someone could die from choking to death on it or die from shock or a heart attack or any other measure of things that happen when you start realising you can barely breathe.

The way you phrase it is as if the police just couldn’t have known tear gas might kill someone and they are all good and absolved because of that. Even if the gas never killed a single protestor, they still wouldn’t be absolved, because like I said, the whole point of tear gas is to basically torture people into dispersing. Does that sound like a good thing in a democracy?

&gt; Can you post evidence to prove your claim that entry into the proud boys requires assaulting an anti-fa member, and is it on their charter or their website?

“To join the Proud Boys, would-be members must go through a four-degree initiation process. The first requires publicly outing oneself as a Proud Boy. The second involves taking a beating from other members until the aspiring Proud Boy can name five kinds of breakfast cereal. This initiation degree also requires a vow to abstain from masturbation. To complete the third degree, the new member must get a Proud Boy tattoo.

The fourth and final degree was added much later by McInnes and is a clear step away from the prankishness of the other rites. It hints at the right-wing bent that the hyperpartisan culture in Trump’s America has served to amplify. The fourth initiation requires that a prospective Proud Boy serve the “cause,” as McInnes suggested, by engaging in a physical brawl with members of “antifa,” the loose-knit far-left and anarchist anti-fascist movement.“

&gt; You have a very warped and twisted worldview of the police, it's really not as corrupt as you seem to think. Police DO protect people, but are largely just a response unit, because your job, as a citizen, is to not break the law. Unless you think there should exist a unit that stops people from breaking laws before they break them... Because otherwise, most people can only ever step in once a law has been broken. That's just how things go.
&gt; Police exist as a deterrent to commit crime, because, you go to prison if you break the law. Some people don't care, so a group of people exist to punish those that break the law

If the job of the police was to help people then they wouldn’t be a very good deterrent to crime, would they? Nobody is going to be deterred from crime by a community support group whose main purpose is serving anyone who needs help in the community. What about an organisation of people who are often quick to randomly turn any possible crime scene violent, up to and including just shooting you if they *think* you have a weapon on you when they arrive? 

If you’ve ever been talked to by the police you know they are manipulative weasels who will absolutely lie to you to trick you into confessing (and it has been decided in the Supreme Court they are allowed to do this and it doesn’t make the conviction unsafe) because their main job is to secure convictions and to secure the capture of those who should be convicted in their eyes. This is true not just in the US but in every country which has a police force. 

&gt; As for police violence, there's over 10 million police arrests a year, ARRESTS, and only about 1000 deaths by police, 19 of which were unarmed suspects, which unarmed is classified as ""Didn't have a gun"" so less than 0.1% of police interactions are violent, or deadly. So that doesn't really sound like it's some massive huge issue, it sounds like, hey this is a problem we can probably fix.

Imagine you are a police officer and you witness, for example, one of the members of your task force using racial slurs against blacks people and saying they’re subhuman. This guy really seems to hate black people. You bring it up with your superior who says “yep, that’s Matt for you”. So you and presumably everyone who works with Matt now has been given notice that this Matt guy is racist and probably doesn’t value black lives that highly. Matt eventually gets in an argument with a black guy who stole from a convenience store and was apprehended nearby and in a fit of rage shoots him in the shoulder. You and two other officers were there, you know the black guy didn’t have a knife/other weapon, and of course the man denies it. Nonetheless, it’s in your interests to lie. You could reasonably have known that Matt was going to escalate things eventually. If your group of officers does not show a united front, there’s a possibility that when investigated you will all be fired or otherwise reprimanded for allowing a man who poses a danger to black people to exist on the force. So on the police report, regardless of what the defendant said, it’s written down as a necessary injury of an armed suspect in self defence. Better that one black person be denied justice (who’s a criminal anyway mind you) than the entire house of cards come down for your local department.

Basically my point is that the police are the ones investigating the scene of the crime. These reports are drafted by them. How can we trust police reports to tell us how many people were actually armed when they were murdered? That’s like expecting someone to grade their own exam.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its better but not what we need. We need a more healthy private system.

I'm fine with sensible gun reform based on data and science. I wish I could simply be in the guns are bad or the guns are good crowd, but I can't. I have to look at data and see what fixes things. For example, you might vehemently oppose this, but waiting periods appear to have a significant impact on some gun issues.

https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/waiting-periods.html

I also think abortion should be safe legal and rare, so that means increasing sex Ed, contraceptive availability, etc.

I do hate Trump though. I don't wish him to die, I definitely hope he fully recovers from covid. But I hate him for what he's done wrt covid, the exacerbation of the division of America into us vs them, his dog whistling, etc.

I have a special dislike for right wing populism because its happening in my home country too, with a massive burst of violence against minorities. I hate it, even though I'm in the majority there technically. Him calling it the China virus led to a massive increase in violence against Asian people, even. Though other outlets initially did, they stopped. He didn't. He keeps inciting violence in a low key denaible way. And I hate violence. So I have to hate him.

Imo you are def a centrist. Not even close to nut job. So congrats I guess???

845,"First off, we need a critical mass of Americans to agree to this truth: **We can reduce the amount of gun violence in America by reducing the number of Americans who have guns.**

That is the ""what"". Once enough of us agree to the ""what"", then we can brainstorm many creative ways to work though the ""how"".

A historical analogy: In 1970 a critical mass of Americans agreed that we could reduce the amount of lung cancer in America by reducing the number of Americans who smoked cigarettes.

After enough Americans agreed to that what, creative tactics were proposed for the how. From PSAs to doctor's advice to warning labels to advertising restrictions to movie portrayals de-glamorizing smoking. And many of those tactics worked, as we went from about 40% of adult Americans smoking down to about 10%. And that reduced our rate of lung cancer, without banning cigarettes.

So to answer your question, I don't think it is time to get into the weeds with specific tactics, as first we need to get enough people to agree to this simple truth: **We can reduce the amount of gun violence in America by reducing the number of Americans who have guns.**",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
846,"I said that gang violence is a major factor when counting US gun homocides. You cannot remove guns from America. Its simply impossible to ban and confiscate over 460 million guns. Making guns illegal wont do anything either. Just look at Mexico. Or Chicago. Guns will be just as cheap on the black market anyway and even if they were more expensive, the only people buying them would be the exact same people that commit crimes so what did you stop or prevent? Also you can easily make your guns at home. You can make a single shot shotgun out of a bunch of pipes, or make a submachinegun out of things found at hardware stores. And dont bring Australia in thsi conversation when they designated gel blasters as firearms. And both the UK and Australia's gun homicide rates where on the decline even before the bans so what did they fix? America has a problem with violence and gangs. Stop blaming the object.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
847,"First of all, see what the text says ""World War I and the flu epidemic ^solved^ the problem of the surplus with a ruthless cull of more than 100 thousand men"". Is the author crazy? WWI and the spanish flu created the Lost Generation, which was the most disposable generation of men ever, being the breeds of fascism, brown shirts, etc. The constant problem of the text is that it seems to believe that surplus of men is a numerical problem. Here you have an example: because WWI killed so men, it also uprooted many. WWI (and the spanish flu) was one of the biggest productions of surplus men ever. This encapsulates my problem with the text.


I live in Argentina. Oh, boy, let me say that whiteness does exist. Let me put some examples. First of all, the middle class of this country is founded from the diaspora of ""surplus white men"", as this calls it, poor europeans (specifically spanish and italians) escaping from hunger there. I am personally a jew, part esquenazi (white) part sefaradi (middle eastern) coming at this time. Latin America has a highly stratified society, were throughout all Latin America, richer people are whiter than poorer people -with more native american traits-, although most are mestizo. This is becaus spanish colonization, of course. The political movements from the poor were called to come from ""negros cabeza"" (niggers), referring to mestizos with higher native american percentage. And various coup d'etats were generating intending. In fact, when the immigration came, the white elites specifically wanted white europeans (specially english and french, they made a mistake here) to come to bring civilization and civilize the savages here. Police routinely target people with darker skin, specially because of using marijuana recreationally. In the last decades, immigrants from nearby poor countries (Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru) came. They are routinely dismissed as sucking up social asistance programs, or as thiefs. What is funny is that when (whiter) argentinians go to Miami, or to Spain and Italy, to go towards civilization and escaping from barbary, there they are treated as going up to sucking up social asistance and to be treated as thiefs.

So, as you can see, there are many similarities to US.

But whiteness operates in a different way in each country. Whiteness is completely unrelated to gun violence in my country, and violence in general. Whiteness is unrelated to misoginy in my country: poor brown people are poorer, and thus more misogynistic. White supremacy interacts with each culture in very different ways. In my country, the main white supremacist strains come from lower middle class claiming for more police and being harder with criminals. Again, lower middle class is browner than the upper middle class, of course. It is a complex issue.

In my country, ""disposable"" white upper middle class men go to live to Miami. But they are not as disposable as the brown lower class men that cannot go anywhere, of course.

&gt;Do you think I'm dehumanizing myself? That's an actual question - I don't think I am, but it would go a long way if you said I were.

Yes, of course, people at Menslib go long ways to dehumanize themselves, as a ritual to be accepted amongst liberals. The pressure to be part of is extremely strong, and the tolerance to recognize the problems of men is still weak. Because of this, I believe many male advocates that are part of liberal environments use self-effacing tactics in order to promote male issues as a trojan horse.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
848,"I'm not against protecting myself, I deserve to live more than someone who wants to hurt me. But I am for thinking things through, and for me it's simple.

We live in a world where you're bombarded with every negative event in a several thousand mile radius daily.

Realistically the odds of you dying due to gun violence are already low. In Chicago, going through the most violent year in recent memory, there've been 605 homicides. Each one of those is a person, I'm not saying their deaths don't matter.

But there are over 3 million people in Chicago. Heart disease has killed more people than guns have in Chicago every day this day. 

Think about that for a second. Taking some time to get physical activity every day, watching your cholesterol, boring shit like that... will protect you from the thing that's more than double as likely to kill you than gun violence in one of the most violent cities in America. 

---

So when take that small probability, and multiply it by the probability that your gun saves you... even if you want to say you're Seal Team Six material and 9 times out of 10 you'd have dropped this dude if he started firing into the car from cover instead of walking in with a knife... you realize it's a small chance.

And someone might say ""well it's worth it even it's a small chance!"" and I agree... but then studies show that you're increasing your risk of dying to a firearm just by having a gun: https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/160/10/929/140858 (and they adjusted for crime and income, those are the confounding factors mentioned)

I mean almost twice as many people die from suicide by guns than by guns. It's not like guns made them commit suicide, but it just shows how few chances your gun actually has to save your life, even if you or someone you know has been unfortunate enough to been in that situation.

The risk of both is small on the grand scale of things, and they cancel out each other better than you'd think. Think about this post even, if 10 people replied to the post right now saying guns saved them, how many tens of thousands of people would have had to have scrolled past and not had that experience?

---

That's why I'm more understanding of people who say they own firearms for fun than this safety tilt. 

You see people jerking off to the times where a good guy with a gun is a hero, but no one ever admits all the times the bad guy would have qualified as a good guy the day before. 

I hear people say what you said in your comment all the time, you all need to realize: ** is no such thing as a good guy
 until the bullets fly **.  Everyone's a good guy until they aren't. People have been having a bad day, pulled out a gun and shot someone over stupid bullshit.

""Normal people aren’t going to break the law, especially with firearms. ""

That's a tautology that a lot of people have in their minds. You're saying normal people are the ones that don't break the law, but as soon as they do the stop being normal people. It's like _because_ they broke the law and say shot some random guy, they must not have ever been normal.

By that logic of course you think normal people don't break the law, only crazy people who go off randomly do. But in reality, there's no such thing as normal people vs abnormal. It's just people.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
849,"&gt; Will I get mugged or shot at for no reason?

Extremely unlikely, but in a country with ~328,000,000 people, it happens to several someones every day. That's simple statistics. The overwhelming majority of people go their entire lives without being targeted by violence here, but *someone,* somewhere, is having a really shitty day at knife- or gun-point, right as I type this.

&gt; Can I walk into a ghetto without getting shot.

I don't know what you mean by 'ghetto,' but the odds are still likely ""yes, you can walk into a ghetto without getting shot or violenced up."" The odds are a lot shorter than they are in most places you wouldn't refer to as a 'ghetto,' though. Poverty and misery make for bleaker and more violent outlooks on life.

&gt; Will they rob me cause I’m Irish and not American?

Overwhelmingly not. Foreigners aren't likely to be targeted for profit-motivated violence, nor for their origins if they're white. As an Irishman, you'd stand better odds of being targeted for sex than violence, frankly, because most Americans have a positive view of the Irish, and a very positive view of most Irish accents, as long as we can understand what you're saying.

&gt; I’ve never seen a gun or seen someone shoot

I'm going to assume you meant to say ""or seen someone shot,"" since seeing someone shooting a firearm and seeing a person get shot by one are in fact two very different things.

The overwhelming majority of Americans go their entire lives without seeing a person get shot. The majority, but not remotely overwhelming majority, go their entire lives without seeing a firearm except on the hips of policemen or in movies and television shows, and never get the pleasure of going to a gun range and shooting them at targets.

I heartily endorse getting a trip to a gun range and learning to handle firearms safely and use them for target practice.

When I say ""America is not safe,"" I am not referring to street crime, or targeted crime because you're Irish; those things *can happen,* but the odds are long on the former and so spectacularly long on the latter as to be unworth mentioning.

I am saying that there is basically no healthcare or other safety net in place, especially if you're a man. (Literally, one of the few programs we *do* have is WIC, or ""Women, Infants &amp; Children"" - fuck you if you're a bloke and need a hand up.) The odds may be long, but I have *personally* been handed a $4,000 hospital bill - for what amounted to lying in a bed for four hours, having some blood drawn, pissing in a cup and taking an aspirin, all to be told that I was not having a cardiac incident but a panic attack, and that I only needed to go home and rest.

As I said: you are not invulnerable. Add to that that this country is being gripped by a fucking *pandemic,* with a ridiculously fractured response, in which about half of the states' official response right now is basically ""go out and party and catch the covids, it's a liberal hoax anyway; at worst it's a bad flu!""

This is not the time to be entering the United States. Especially if you're *Irish* Irish and not Northern Irish and thus about to be royally *buggered* by BoJo the Malevolent Clown and his buddy Nigel the Bus-Boy.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To me that means that he’s actually doing something illegal tantamount to goading violence after sitting on the most powerful chair in the world. Any civilized country in this day and age should shut everything down at this point and drag him out of the office. The secret service should have intervened and said I’m sorry mr president but this is against the laws of our democratic constitution and you will no longer be considered president.

When do we do that is my question. If trump got up and killed a man right there on stage. If he pulled out a gun and shot Biden. 

Would we still let him go Free of consequences because he is the president? If he straight up says that the coronavirus doesn’t exist and 200000 people die because of that, do we still not remove him ?

Where is the limit I’m asking the American people? Or do the American people not have that power at all? Can the president decide to ask his supporters to commit racial violence and still be president of the United States ?

Do we just let him do all that ?? 

Will the moderator just say “very interesting” and move on? 

Will we all just say “it is what it is” and move on?

It’s already happening. People lose their children to gun violence in schools because the other side can’t let their man child toys weapons go. 

We’ve already lost so many people because we don’t have healthcare and don’t have a proper response to pandemics. Where do we draw the fucking line. At what point can we say that this man has failed so hard and has actively burned down so much of our country by misusing his platform as the most powerful man in the world and stroking the fans of racism and division and anti science propaganda. 

Did osama bin laden himself fly the plane that crashed into the towers? 

No! He used his position of power to influence terrorist individuals under his influence to go and commit those acts. We held him rightfully responsible for it.

WHEN DO WE HOLD THIS MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR USING HIS POSITION OF POWER AND INFLUENCE AND DENYING THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES THEIR RIGHTS OF GOVERNMENT CARE WHEN A NATIONAL EMERGENCY PANDEMIC HAS HIT THE COUNTRY AND KILLED 200000 OF US.

852,"&gt; He was using his right to bear arms and stand around an area as a deterrent.

Have you ever taken a firearms course? Even in my very pro-gun state, people who open carry have several responsibilities and liabilities. It differs from state to state but in most you can't use your weapon as a deterrent in public. If you can reasonable forsee yourself in need of your fire arm and can escape without using it you're supposed too. Even in states with castle doctrine you're supposed to retreat to your home if possible and are only allowed to fire if you feel you can't make it in your home without them forcing in after you. 

&gt; These things are decided in court, you would have to make your case to see if violence or even deadly violence was appropriate to retrieve the property. Most kids when caught stealing will fess  and return the stolen item.

No, a court can't bring someone back to life when some idiot decides that he's judge, jury, and executioner. The court is there for when the police find the people who stole the property and are brought to court. 

&gt; Lastly I’m sick of people thinking they can get away with whatever they want. It goes back to what I said earlier an armed society is a polite society.

That makes no sense...... We are living in the most polite times in human history and it isn't because of guns. Just look at the violent crime rate in america, before covid we were at an all time low. Crime is spurred by lack of opportunities and systems of abject poverty, we are all just more aware of the crime we see because of the internet.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
853,I’m gonna disagree hard here on the no gun violence problem if you look at our stats compared with other countries. Also I’m not pawning it off as a racial issue cause that just passes the buck to avoid responsibility. Lots of gun accidents happen that could be avoided. It’s not about how many murders happen cause that’s not what we are trying to solve. The issue is that guns are a tool designed to kill efficiently and in some cases are designed to kill a lot of things fast. A murderer with a semi automatic is going to do a lot more damage a lot quicker than a murderer with a fist or a knife. So the question is do we try to keep the murderer from having access to a more efficient weapon. Is America really safer when everyone has a gun? The more guns are out there the more guns will be owned by the wrong people(murderers). Personally if my guns disappeared tomorrow my life would be no different so it’s hard for me to see why adding barriers to entry is a bad idea. The likelihood of someone actually needing a gun outside of hunting is pretty low.,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So what you're saying is making gun possession illegal reduces violence in America and thus eliminates school shootings? Yes/No?

&gt; So just try fuck all is your stance then yeah?

No my stance is not to be a dolt and think the logical response to illegal gun crimes issues is to (unconstitutionally) take guns away from those not perpetrating any gun crimes and meanwhile those who still want to criminally possess them will always have access and ability to utilize them in crimes.

America also just has a gun availability problem. We have at least 4 times more guns per person than any of the countries you list.

I am proposing that we deal with gun control the same way we would deal with the tax dodgers in the example. Penalize criminals according the the already existing laws, don't limit gun rights for law abiding citizens and educate people on the proper safety, provide resources for mental health for suicides (60% of gun deaths in America), vocational training and education for financially vulnerable and educate people on safe handling of fire arms.

Education (vocational / academic) increases your marketability and value as a worker.  You are able to get better jobs and don't have to compete with as many applicants, your quality of life improves, you can reliably provide for yourself and your family.  You break the cycle of poverty.

Gang culture revolves around drugs/money, power and violence.  In order to be respected you need to demonstrate extreme violence, the threat of violence is what prevents competitors/rivals from selling in your community, you make money which allows you to buy more drugs, illegal guns and be more violent.  The whole thing stems from financial insecurity. So if you address the presence of financial insecurity and provide reliable resources/alternatives  it removes the need for supplemental income (drug money).

Regardless of their ""main goal"", they want to disarm the citizenry and arguing that they don't is not an argument in good faith. 


Additionally, if disarming the citizenry solved violent crime, then Central and South America would be much, much more peaceful places. As long as you have a war on drugs and the constant,  systemic legal and economic oppression of peoples, you will have violent crime. Pretending guns are the cause instead of a symptom of a much larger issue is a cheap copout that won't solve anything.

Two things:

1) In the act of trying to actually save a life. ACTUALLY doing that and making a mistake - not shooting a guy 7 times in the back, not shooting someone driving away from you who isn't a threat, not sitting on a guy actively restricting his breathing, not falsifying CI testimony to get no-knock warrants, not commenting as a man chokes on his vomit then doing nothing to respond... quite the difference

2) Bar is a bit higher when you need more than two years of community college to do your fucking job while sure as fuck not collecting tax-payer funded overtime pay hand over fist - actively seeking out more education as a requirement for your fucking job that amounts to more than more time on the gun range while spending your budgets on life-saving equipment and training.

More cops die a year from accidents on the job than in violence. More have heart attacks on duty.

To act like gun laws will just lead to everyone running each other over with cars is absurd. We have plenty of data to show that violence is worse in certain countries and often times guns play a huge role in that. 

Lastly I highly recommend you look into the science being how easy it is to pull a trigger and how hard it is to fight someone to death in a knife fight. Meaning Far to often you see innocent bystanders get killed or the shooter not meaning to kill. Whereas a knife that won’t happen. I can’t have a stray knife hit a child. I can’t half brained pull a trigger and release my actions later. That’s the whole point of this study. People with little education can’t comprehend that pulling that trigger truly is a last resort thing. If I wanted to kill with a knife I can’t just merely not think about it and pull a trigger. I have to aggressively thrust into someone which is not as moral easy as pulling a trigger.

****

He had a knife in his car. But he wasn't holding it. They claimed he was, but I didn't see on in the video.

Furthermore, your argument doesn't work in this situation. Jacob Blake was shot in the back 6 times. He was shot trying to enter his car. He wasn't an immediate threat to officers and unless they think he can find a gun in his car, shoot it forward, and curve the bullet to hit them, they were in no immediate danger.

They shot Jacob Blake not because he was a threat to their lives, but because he was being difficult and they lost their temper with him.

If you or I were in this situation, it wouldn't be a question if we were going to be charged with murder or not. Why is it that cops have less accountability when it comes to the use of deadly force than average citizens? Most people can only use deadly force as a self defense when their lives are actively in danger. Not when they suspect that their lives may be potentially be in danger if the aggressor becomes more hostile.


&gt; A cops first and foremost duty is to come home after the shift is over. They are a person just like you and me, that want to go home to their loved ones at the end of the day.

Sure, and most cops don't mind making sure other people can't go to their loved ones if they even remotely perceive they themselves are in any danger.

A cop's duty, as an officer, is work in the best interests of the public. If an officer believes he is unable to do that, then he/she should not be in a position of authority. 

If you want a safe job with no risk, don't be a cop in America. If you sign up to be a cop, you know the risks.


&gt; Police are not millitary. They do not wear the same kind of armor they do not have the same kind of wepons, or the same training. They don't work the same way. 

Exactly. Police are not military. They aren't at risk in fighting armed and trained terrorists. They aren't dealing with guys armed with Ak-47s and wearing body armor. They're dealing with assholes armed with knives, clubs, and maybe a handgun. These assholes aren't even actively targeting the cops, like how terrorists actively target military personnel.

Cops deal with far less risk then military personnel do. Yet they have far less accountability for their actions and far more leeway to use violence to solve issues.

&gt; If police wait for someone to shoot them first then there will be a whole lot more cops.

Okay let's compromise. How about if cops only decided to shoot people when they see a perpetrator hold a gun? They can't shoot somebody because they suspect they have a gun nearby. Sound fair?",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For one, ""they"" dont demand anything, police unions and precincts may demand things but you have no idea what individual officers opinions are.

For another, they do have a dangerous job. Uber being a shitty job/company has nothing to do with that and I have a feeling that violence involving police officers is severly underrported, both as aggressors and victims. One of the many reasons we need reforms, including bodycams.

And thirdly, no, ACAB it's not a succinct way of explaining anything. It's a needlessly inflammatory slogan, started by white supremacists, that only shows you have absolutly zero regard for any troubles faced by law enforcement. And you should, a lack of training and support for officers is one of the reasons america has problems with police. A better trained officer isnt reaching for his gun nearly as much.

God why is this always such a hard sell to explain that institutional problems doesnt meen that every single person involved is part of that problem. The issues with police have far more to do with absolutly terrible leadership within individual precincts and unions and how they respond to brutality and racism, than the actions of individual cops.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
885,"There’s a lot to unpack in this post, I’ll do my best. 

1: Yes, some drunk drivers re-offend. You don’t hear about the ones that don’t, and you only really hear about the ones who kill people. Many have serious addictions issues we don’t properly treat, while others are truly sociopaths with little regard for the rest of us. Judges don’t know whether the person before them on their first DUI is someone who made a stupid mistake and will never do it again, or if they’re going to get back in their car two nights later and diss a stop-light. Things is, it’s wrong to give the 90% of people who don’t re-offend a grossly disproportionate penalty to try and fight the 10% that do. This is the problem with relying on the news to get all your info on this stuff - the old adage that “if it bleeds, it leads” is true. 

2: most of the gun violence in our city is a consequence of our failed drug policies. It’s created incentives and profit margins that literally incentivize murder. Increasing punishments won’t stop that - look at the US. The death penalty doesn’t stop their drug dealers from killing each other - it won’t here. There’s tons of Social Science research on this. The solution is community level intervention to get between kids and gang life, meaningful access to rehabilitation in prisons when that fails, and a complete re-ordering of our drug policies. The Public Prosecution Service (the federal attorneys who prosecute drug crime) literally last week came out saying they weren’t going to prosecute possession anymore (in most cases). It’s a public health issue, not a crime one. 

3: your point about perception mattering more than reality is both super insightful and really sad. People feel strongly about crime - they’re worried about it all the time, despite the fact that we live in one of the safest big cities in North America. Facts, not emotions or misinformed public sentiment, should guide policy.

4: you say that since rehab isn’t working we should just be more punitive. Two problems with this. First, rehab isn’t working because we aren’t committed to it. Wanna see rehabilation work? Look to countries that actually fund it - go read the Federal and provincial ombudsman’s reports on prisons and see how little money gets put into rehab. If you’re going to use it’s failure as justification for harsher penalties, then we should actually try it. Second, as mentioned earlier, harsher punishments don’t work. They don’t deter crime and they serve only to harden criminals in jail, creating a cycle of violence and criminality that’s counter productive. 


5: They do publish numbers - stats Can and the ombudsmen for both Ontario and Federal prisons release reports regularly.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
886,"Soooo... I'm not a lawyer or a legal scholar, so I can only tell you my personal opinion.

I have really mixed feelings about red flag laws (for others reading, those are laws that allow the state to take away a person's guns with a court order if a judge finds that he or she raises certain ""red flags,"" mostly having to do with domestic violence). 

On the one hand, intimate partner homicide is one of the leading causes of violent death in America (and the world), and the single greatest predictor of a domestic violence incident leading to death is the presence of a gun. (For more, see NO VISIBLE BRUISES by Rachel Louisa Snyder.) 

On the other hand, those laws (and all gun control laws) are almost always applied more often, more harshly, and with greater collateral consequences to poor people and, especially people of color. (I wrote about this issue in 2014: [https://www.friendsjournal.org/quaker-argument-gun-control/](https://www.friendsjournal.org/quaker-argument-gun-control/))

So... where do I stand? I don't know. I think we'd be better off without handguns. I also think we'd be better off in a society that was less patriarchal, emotionally impoverished, and capitalist--and therefore less violent. But we don't seem interested in changing those things. So, we get the problems we deserve.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
887,"&gt;Because, and this ought to defuse you before you go digging for your shitty article links full of typos and assumptions, ***the CDC has not been allowed to do this research. Your words ""defensive gun use"" are no more codified or tracked than ""school shootings"".***

This is an oft-repeated sentiment by people who have no idea what they're talking about. The CDC absolutely can (and does) do research about gun violence. The thing you're talking about prevents them from issuing policy recommendations, not from getting funding or conducting research.

&gt;Two people with guns having a confrontation isn't two guns *saving* two people; it's two gun crimes occurring simultaneously, with serious potential for either party to be harmed or killed, *as well as anyone within a hundred feet.*

It's not a crime to defend yourself with a firearm in this country, so no. [This article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulhsieh/2018/04/30/that-time-the-cdc-asked-about-defensive-gun-uses/) references a 2013 study ordered by the CDC about the frequency of defensive gun uses by victims of crimes. It comes with multiple estimates of how common they are, but at least 105,000 uses of firearms *defensively* occur *every year*.

The reason for the difficulty in estimating a hard number is because people like you think self-defense is a crime. It becomes a huge legal battle to even draw a firearm, let alone use it. Many people simply don't report that they pulled a firearm in self-defense if they didn't actually fire.

&gt;The US habitually refuses to admit anything related to this (see previously mentioned CDC denials when attempting to even begin to quantify the actual harm done) so it's always going to be hard for the morons and thickheads to understand, but, ***you dumbfucks are the only country in the world to be able to say ""we have routine school shootings.""*** PIf you think that's not at all related to the fact that you also have more guns than people, ***you're a fucking idiot, period, and go away forever.*** No argument will reach you, and no sense either, because you're smart enough to recognize both and you rail against them for ""muh rights"".

Ironic that you repeatedly call me a ""fucking idiot"" when you either can't or won't understand that the CDC isn't barred from doing firearm studies. Plain and simple, you're being fed a lie.

&gt;Yes, the fantasy. Most gun nuts have one. It's a murder-fetish fantasy where they're the big hero of the day because they used the gun to be strong and stop someone from doing something. But legally speaking, in most cases (and in basically every civilized nation, since America has been established to *not be civilized*), you shooting someone in your home in the dark is simply *not self defense.* You didn't *defend* anything, you attacked with deadly weapons.

It is, legally. You don't have to agree with that provision, but it overwhelmingly is self-defense to shoot someone who is unlawfully entering your home.

&gt;&gt; Where in your mind did I imply that I'd shoot a child?
&gt;
&gt;You didn't, but you've established that you're entirely okay with the concept of a room full of children dead by gunshot, as long as it means you get to keep your guns.

Nope, I didn't. You just don't know how to read. I'm not ok with that at all, actually. But you seem to think ""I'm not ok with that, and here's my solution, so if you don't like my solution you must be ok with that.""

That isn't how logic works. Not even a little bit.

&gt;Not having a gun is not a punishment, *unless you're ready to go to the doctor to admit you're addicted to the feeling it gives you.* That's the MCC right there - you NEED that metal cock to make you feel whole. That disability in your personage can be corrected and treated.

Careful, your C- in Psychology 101 is showing, Freud.

&gt;Show me the available scientific statistics that prove exactly how many citizens' guns a dead child pays for. That's what this has come down to, again; you're pro-dead-kid, *and the rest of the world isn't stupid like you are so we need you to explain that viewpoint.*
&gt;
&gt;None of this would matter if you idiots could just have guns *responsibly,* but it's clear that your entire purpose of having them is specifically to be irresponsible.

Yes, yes. We get it. You'd rather attack my character than make an actual argument. I'm not pro-dead-kid and I haven't said anything that would lead a reasonable well-educated person to assume I am.

In spite of what you think, the **overwhelming majority** of firearm owners are responsible. There are 100,000,000 of us. I know you folks like to think I'm part of a group of about 1,000 crazies holding 300,000,000 guns, but the reality is very different. A small handful of people abuse that right and I completely support their prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.

I'm not sure why I'm clarifying any of this, because you don't actually care. If you stopped jerking off to your moral superiority we might actually be able to have a civil conversation. For now, you've made that impossible. I'll give you one thing, though, you're awfully creative with your insults. They don't mean anything and they're plainly counterproductive, but they're unique. You must think about penises an awful lot to think up all the different ways to insult mine.

I'm curious what this ""civilized nation"" you live in is, though. My money is on the UK but I'm interested to see if I'm right.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
888,"That was poor English and made no sense. I support the BLM protests, but not the riots or looting. I disagree that things would be better without a police force, which is the goal of the people rioting in Portland. I disagree with them shining lasers into people's eyes and assaulting people. The far right is more violent. That also has nothing to do with anything. They're not fighting the far right. There are no fascists for Antifa to confront. Trying to end the police force and prisons is an insane idea. Of course the police need more reforms and all cops who kill people should be accountable.

But also, of course we need a police force. Gun violence in July this year was double what it was last July, thanks to the Portland police removing their gun violence unit, which was in response to the protests and riots.

They're doing more harm than good. Those people rioting in Portland aren't helping black people. They're breaking stay at home orders during a pandemic.

And as I said, they will get Trump a second term. They are not winning hearts and minds. They are making people hate them.

889,"&gt; “tax the rich out of existence”

I know this sounds like hyperbole, but when you consider what a wealth tax actually is, and that the [democrats are openly discussing it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/economic-inequality/wealth-tax/), it should insense anyone who has managed to build a nest egg of any size.  

&gt; A wealth tax is typically a tax on a net worth (the difference between someone’s assets and liabilities).

&gt; For example, if somebody has $500,000 of assets and $300,000 of debt, that person’s wealth (or net worth) is $200,000 and a 2% wealth tax would generate a $4,000 tax bill.

This is the most destructive thing to the middle class that I can possibly think of.  Imagine being in your early 40's, and you're solidly on track to having a retirement, and paying for the kids' college, and then the government decides that it's going to take 2% off the top of your savings, 401(k), and home equity.   Can you imagine having to sit down and write a cheque to the IRS for what could easily be $10,000+?  Or waking up day and seeing that the IRS simply deducted that money from your account?   The notion infuriates me.  Unfortunately, there's no tea to dump in the harbor over such taxation.

&gt; [We believe we should ensure that guns don’t fall into the hands of terrorists (whether they be domestic or foreign), domestic abusers, other violent criminals, or those who have shown signs of danger toward themselves or others.](https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/the-issues/preventing-gun-violence/) 

Based on the history of the United States of America, I'd like to posit that anyone who may be subject to a wealth tax may also fall into the category of becoming dangerous to themselves or others.  And with the monitoring of social media, and the use of artificial intelligence to build social networks though [social network analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis) techniques, it's going to be impossible to put up any sort of organized resistance (non-violent or otherwise).  

I'm begging to run a little long here, and I'm happy to discuss.  

I'll leave you with this quote:

&gt; 
“A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years. These nations have progressed through this sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to selfishness; From selfishness to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage.”

891,"I'm expecting to be downvoted to hell for this. 

But since people don't like reading links and Biden's gun plan is full of 1984-esque bullshit...well, [here](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/)

&gt;In 2005, then-Senator Biden voted [against](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00219) the [Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/397)

Democrats will try to tell you that gun manufacturers can't be sued for anything. That's horseshit, they get sued over QC issues whenever there's...well, QC issues. 

What the PLCAA prevents is Democratic politicians frivolous-lawsuiting gun manufacturers out of business. 

The logic behind it - holding manufacturers for criminal misuse of their product - is entirely ridiculous (unless you really hate the Second Amendment), unless you're also in favor of letting Ford and Chevy be sued for DUIs committed with their cars. 

&gt;Joe Biden will enact legislation to once again ban assault weapons. This time, the bans will be designed based on lessons learned from the 1994 bans. For example, the ban on assault weapons will be designed to prevent manufacturers from circumventing the law by making minor changes that don’t limit the weapon’s lethality.

A.) ""Assault weapons"" are an entirely made-up class of firearms that only exist in Democratic legislation to ban them 

B.) What Democrats actually want to ban are common modern semiautomatics, which flies in the face of the Common Use clause of Heller and Caetano. 

C.) AWBs are overwhelming cosmetic-based bans designed to cover the most amount of common firearms as possible, they don't target anything to do with ""the weapon's lethality"" as is 

&gt;This will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act.

This is the biggest load of bullshit out of his entire plan. 

A.) See the problem with ""assault weapons"" above 

B.) ""High capacity magazines"", to Democrats, is generally anything over 10 rounds, i.e. the majority of standard capacity magazines for modern firearms. 

C.) The NFA involves a minimum of $200 in fees, and a wait time in the months, **per item**. Biden wants that to be retroactively applied to common modern firearms and **their individual standard capacity magazines**. 

(I'm a 100% legal gun owner. Biden wants to fine me nearly $20,000 for legally exercising my Second Amendment right)

D.) If you can't or won't fuck with his extortion fee, **he will confiscate your guns**.

&gt;In order to reduce the stockpiling of firearms, Biden supports [legislation](https://marchforourlives.com/peace-plan/) restricting the number of firearms an individual may purchase per month to one.

Change ""firearms"" to ""books"" and make this a First Amendment issue. Hopefully it becomes apparent as to why doing this to any Constitutional right is a shit idea. 

&gt;End the online sale of firearms and ammunitions. Biden will enact [legislation](https://marchforourlives.com/peace-plan/) to prohibit all online sales of firearms, ammunition, kits, and gun parts.

This genius (/s) is apparently unaware that Joe Average can't have a gun Amazon-ed to his door ready to go, it needs to go an FFL (think gun store) who then conducts the background check and transfer of the firearm. 

&gt;Incentivize state “extreme risk” laws.

AKA ""Red Flag Laws"" 

AKA ""Abusing ex parte orders to take guns and worry about due process later"" 

&gt;Give states incentives to set up gun licensing programs.

A right that requires a license is no longer a right. 

And seeing how Democrats are perfectly fine with sheriffs abusing May Issue legislation for CCW permits under the auspices of ""using their discretion""\*, I can guarantee it will be utilized to keep as many guns out of as many hands as possible, 2A be damned. 

\* (read: make significant campaign donations to the sheriff's re-election campaign a de facto requirement and being allowed to be as discriminatory as they want) 

&gt;Put America on the path to ensuring that 100% of firearms sold in America are smart guns.

Read: require a simple machine (a firearm) that's main purpose is in life-or-death situations (where seconds absolutely count) to be inundated with technology that exponentially increases the potential points of failure, in addition to driving the price up.

&gt;Require gun owners to safely store their firearms. 

As an after-the-fact idiot tax that comes if something happens and it's deemed it wasn't stored correctly? I can get behind that. 

But proactive enforcement is going to end up being another nail in the coffin of what used to be the 4th Amendment. 

RIP ""reasonable searches"" if you give law enforcement the ability to harass citizens to ostensibly ""make sure if there's any guns in the house that they're stored safely"".

In fact we have banned more guns and restricted ownership in the last 2 decades yet suicides are up massively.

899,"No hard feelings, but I want to caution against the idea that anyone needs to avoid “racist red” areas in America.

The thing about categorizing any region as “racist” or “red” is that it erases the many people who live in those communities who are victims of racism and the Republican Party. These places are defined by their white residents and by a media that is concentrated not only in urban areas, but a small handful of urban areas. People who don’t ever live in or come from these places, don’t get an accurate idea of what they are like. These areas are certainly not as homogenous as people seem to think. 

Speaking in terms of North Carolina, the vast majority of Native Americans in North Carolina live in rural areas that are what most people would classify as the “racist red” areas. I don’t think people think of a Native American face when they picture rural America. 

Many historically black communities in North Carolina are in these “racist red areas.” In my home county in North Carolina, which you better believe is a “racist red” area ??, there is a very old historically black rural town where many black families can trace their lineage back for many generations—pre-civil war. 
(Some people may not know why places like this are special, so to explain: black communities all over America were ravaged by racist mobs, so much of the history of these places and people is lost). 

There is also a large and growing hispanic population in many “red” areas around here as a result of agricultural and manufacturing recruitment as well as the swell of refugees from Central America. The racist, anti-immigrant, white people may not admit it, but they too love having delicious quality tacos that are readily accessible, but just next to every gun store. (This is not meant to be threatening to immigrants; there are just that many gun stores).

We'll see... I don't think Antifa has actually accomplished much but BLM has perhaps done a bit more, but still mostly token gestures so far. Also, BLM is morphing and has not been a complete peaceful protest (even if I don't necessarily blame BLM instances of violence).

&gt;The monopoly on violence has always been government

Which is actually basically the definition of a functioning gov't - so yes, on your second point, aside from Kamala Harris, I would agree that it's really important who leads that. Trump and the GOP is far, far worse than anything KH would do, even if what she's accused of is 100% true.

Look, I hate this pick as well even if I knew it was coming months ago. She definitely seems like more of an opportunist with political savvy, rather than someone who has a vision on what America could be and has thrown it to the people to buy in. That said, I also recognize that there has been a lot of bad-faith arguments to all candidates so I've been trying. Any opinions on this?

https://www.sfweekly.com/news/looking-back-on-kamala-harris-record-in-california/

I'm mostly ignorant since I don't follow California specifically so otherwise, it's far less information for me to dissect and collate into a coherent opinion. SFweekly is supposedly has a 'centrist-bias' FWIW.

However, I still maintain that there's no comparison to Trump or any of the rank-step GOP.

&gt; But I'll take Trump over Kamala in this race because eventually the Dems will understand that they can just present garbage and claim it's diamonds. Clinton lost and Ill bet Kamala Harris will too. I can't think of anyone as dangerous as Kamala Harris from the part couple decades.. Maybe Cheney or Trump Sr? Reagan I suppose, he was a nasty piece of work.

I think that's hyperbole. Clinton shouldn't have lost and the VP position doesn't do much (unless you're Cheney with Bush), though I do recognize Biden has a markedly higher chance of being one or less term. But by the health metric, should we not also consider who would be Trump's VP? If it's still Pence, holy shit did he fuck over Indiana and would usher in more of a fundamentalist gov't. I'd be more worried about that.

Also, as much as much the Reagan era started us down this shit-tastic voyage, he still would be a better choice than Trump right now, just as much as Bush would be now. 

But Cheney is garbage :)",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
906,"Why are you comparing a developing country that has a GDP per capita of 1/4 of the USA? Why not compare to other more similar developed countries?

Oh Wait it’s just because if you compare it to developed European or Asian country americas gun violence/murder rate is atrocious and it makes America and their opinion on guns look stupid.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
907,"America might lead, but they are certainly not a distinctly American event. Evil exist everywhere and if you think it's somehow bound by country borders, you are very naive. There are plenty of knife attacks in these other countries you are probably missing by thinking it's a gun problem only. If you are going to quote gun violence you have to quote any sort of weapon like that. I'd rather be shot then stabbed, to be honest.

""More people died in the recent storm in bangladesh than have ever been killed by police in america but nobody really cares because you can't use floods to justify racial reforms"" sounds *incredibly stupid* but works if you just ignore motive and emotions as any basis for reasoning. 

Same with gun violence in the US, number of victims isn't that high, esp when you take out suicides and don't massage the data (the school shootings data a while back did this and idk why, its serious enough without streching the difination to a breaking point) but people care about it because **idk they're designed to kill things?**

I think this just another reason why we need to rethink our media, but this isn't an indication of ""out to get whitey/media blackout conspiracy lefty propaganda"" taking over America.

I'll happily admit that the argument is a bit absurd.  It was intended to be.  Only a nutjob would argue that a random citizen ought to have city destroying firepower in good faith.  My point was that a fully literal interpretation of that particular sentence suggests that a random citizen ought to have a right to city destroying firepower.  ""Arms"" is so vague a word that it applies to my P238 *and* an aircraft carrier with enough firepower to level a nation.

917,"&gt;Even if you train a lot there is still a lot of luck involved.

I understand this thoroughly, and it also really depends on the situation - and I have learned how to generally avoid those kinds of situations, but sometimes it's unavoidable. 

Honestly, the only situation I see myself being able to adequately pull my firearm in, is one like the Texas church shooter, where the active shooter was not aware of/looking at the person who ended up neutralizing the threat. 

&gt;don't ever try and draw your gun if someone already has their gun out and pointed at you. You'll get yourself killed. It doesn't work the way you've seen in TV shows and movies.

The only situations I have to compare it to, are the two I were in, and in both situations the person holding the firearm turned their entire head at one point, turning their attention away from me. After the second time I told myself if I was ever in that situation again - I wouldn't let that opportunity pass me by again. 

Whether I fail or not isn't the point - it's the refusal to live in the fear that comes after. I'd rather die than live through that again - I don't fear death. I survived cancer through rigorous chemo last year, and frankly while I do not want to die, I will welcome death with open arms when my time comes. I know how I want to live, and I refuse for it to be in fear. It's that simple. 

I'm trying to move to Ireland, get a BA in Human Rights and a PhD in Political Science so I can no longer be in those sorts of situations. I believe that all life is precious, but not at the cost of self-preservation and innocent life. I'd rather remove the need for self preservation entirely. Food, housing, education, Healthcare and employment (income) are 21st century human rights and im going to figure out a way to make it possible - even if we don't implement it. Because fuck man - no one ***wants*** to live like this, and I need to do *something* to try and solve it. Remove the feelings of desperation and necessity (inability to pay bills/for food, or to get Healthcare), de-escalate passionate crimes (change education to include mental health and self-care), reduce the normalization of greed - and the use for violence basically evaporates. 

I'm *tired* man. Living *anywhere* is fucking exhausting (america uniquely so) - and it doesn't have to be that way. We don't *have* to live this way.

Just like the cop that murdered him. He was a piece of shit too. Sometimes two pieces of shit hit each other and a shit sandwich is what we end up with.

919,"&gt;2) that defending you’re self is a universal right

I don't disagree. Again, I think it's a political impossibility to change the gun laws. Moreover, I don't necessarily think its required to reduce gun violence in America. I believe that things will work better if we address the other factors and keep gun owners involved and active participants in the process of reducing gun violence. 

I believe in the right of self-defense: I believe that a farmer needs a rifle, and I believe that a city dweller may have one. 

America is more diverse, because it has areas of wild diversity (particularly its coastal areas.) A place like Miami is without much comparison.

However it has a lot of areas in the middle which are not particularly diverse. Germany has less of that because it's more compact (which is to say, the diversity, while less than America's, reaches deeper into what is called Middle Germany, and so the average German has more experience with it.) 

&gt;1) the violence on our borders

Overflow of violence from Mexico due to the failed drug war and the organized crime which was prospered under it. 

Drugs come up from Mexico, and guns from the US flow downwards. 

This is the result of a long running failure of the drug war. That was a peaceful border region prior to the 70s--and relatively open without much difficulty. I remember crossing it in the 90s in El Paso and at that time walking back into the US you said ""American"" to a border control agent and that was all. They were annoyed when I got my passport out. My friends from El Paso thought it was funny. 

That for me is a key factor. Ridiculous over-imprisonment and law enforcement system which has fed into that has increased crime and violence. The other factors being racism and economic problems which I addressed earlier.

Full disclosure: Some of these links probably dont work anymore as I haven't maintained this list as well as I should have. 

Science and data very clearly and thoroughly demonstrate that gun control does not work. Best case scenario, it does nothing, worst case, it correlates with worsening crime rates. Being anti gun is going against science and supporting the removal of power from the citizenry for no reason. Dont let fear rule you.

There is plenty more but this is far more than enough to validate my claims.

924,"Japanese culture and American culture are incredibly different. Sure, the laws make a difference for gun violence, but are the laws really the primary difference that makes this statistic? You can quote statistics all day and be misinterpreting what they really mean. 

Maybe it was Japanese culture around guns that led them to make the law. In other words, maybe it wasn’t the law that caused the statistic but the statistic that caused the law. Crime and law are also different between Japan and the US. You seem to say that gun violence in America is purely a result of a lack of gun regulation. Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the US but also has a massive problem with gun violence. Gun violence is a symptom of a much larger problem than whether or not there is a law. Problems like structural racism, the war on drugs, culture around drug and alcohol abuse, organized crime, the mentality of consumer culture, and so on.

These gun violence statistics are not coming from the Deep South or from “liberteh” toting redneck. Why does everyone roast hillbillies when the real problems are coming from the cities. The laws and the law enforcement and the government aren’t immune to corruption either. The government sticks its hand where it doesn’t belong all the time.

In my opinion, it is dangerous to assume that the government is in charge of fixing our problems. There is no easy way to fix these things other than community centered activism, hard work, and time.

Of course gun laws and regulations are important and do make a difference. All I’m saying is that the problem goes a lot deeper than gun laws and shouldn’t be seen as such a cut and dry thing.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
925,"Lol. This is the same as the ""few bad apples"" argument about police forces. 

Statistically speaking, in comparison with the rest of the industrialized world, America has extremely lax gun ownership laws, extremely high gun ownership, high levels of gun violence and a pretty crappy public education system. 

Even if it is ""just"" 10% of gun owners who are not responsible, 1 in 10 idiots with guns can do a lot of damage. Moreover, that fraction of irresponsible gun owners is the direct result of systemic problems with regulation, education and the gun culture. 

It's not enough to just be one of the ""responsible"" gun owners, you actually need a system that forces every gun owner to be responsible. But I guess that would impinge on people's ""freedoms"" lol.

926,"Lmao...who believes cops stop rape? I'm going to try not to preach to you, but if you educate yourself about sexual violence, you'll learn most rapes are committed by close friends and family, in a dark quiet place, like their own home. Of course police don't ""stop rapes""...that's nonsense, because it's impossible to prevent that from happening. Do you picture in your mind, a woman walking through a dark alleyway, a rapist emerging from the shadows, and raping her, just before she can dial 911? That's not even close to reality.

I agree, cops can't always be there to prevent things, but a 45 minute response time by the police to a violent crime is utterly, irresponsible, dangerous, and unacceptable. I do get your point, but making sure you're gun is ready so you can shoot the bad guys is not the answer, the answer is a more effective gun control, and a better educated and trained police force. That's what works in the rest of the civilized world, that's what would work for America. 

On the other hand, it looks like you guys are about to enter a type of totalitarian era yourself, so you might be right about needing to be armed, because this time you guys might actually have to overthrow a government that's already testing the waters with disappearing the ""dissidents"" among it's population.

927,"Neither.

About 50 years ago, a group of Americans realized that they could reduce the amount of lung cancer in America by reducing the amount of cigarette smokers in America.

They then spent decades re-engineering America so that far fewer people were interested in smoking cigarettes.

The exact same techniques can be used to create an America in which few people want to own guns.

929,"Speaking as an American, our history of vigilante style community policing cannot be separated from the fact that the communities they police and the social structures they enforce are racist ones- the KKK being the most notable example. For Black Americans in much of the country, Klan violence and Police violence were virtually indistinguishable, with Officers wearing badges by day and hoods by night. It is no coincidence that the 'fall' of the Klan and the rise of unionized police departments happened on roughly the same timeline. The same can be said of contemporary white supremacist protectionist militias in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, and with New York's 'subway angels' in the 80s, which were deeply racist. The fact is that these community police have the exact same function (and often the same membership) as the state police- to patrol the invisible class/race border between the two Americas. Simply handing over the keys to the tank from one group to another will not do. 

Police are not the only white men with guns killing with impunity. Badge or no badge, 'crime' in america will never be solved or abated with policing, community or otherwise. We need deeper systemic change that alters the way we socialize our children and deploys ruthless self-interrogation on those of us already adults so that we can understand fully the ways in which our rearing in a racist capitalist patriarchy affects our own personal epistemology, and roots them out. We need resilient communities which are policed by the sheer force of the strength of their community ties and social contracts, not any badge or any gun. 

When the people are being beaten with a stick, they are not much happier if it is called 'the People's Stick.'",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,"Chicago is a unique and complicated situation when it comes to the history of black people in the city and also gang violence.

You have to understand that Chicago is the most segregated large city in America. It has been that way for 100+ years. Also, most of the black people in Chicago came over in two great migrations, once in the 1900's and again in the 1940's. They moved to Chicago because there were jobs in factories. The problem is that the government and the people already living in Chicago did not want blacks in the city. You can do research and learn there were lynchings in Chicago and it was very common to see extreme violence between the European immigrants and the blacks migrating from the South. 

As a result laws were passed specifically to segregate black people into pockets of the city. There were ordinances that limited where blacks could live, the city build expressways to keep blacks out of certain areas of town. Large public housing developments were made specifically to concentrate black people. 

Around the 1960's the manufacturing jobs left Chicago and these black areas of town suddenly had large unemployment issues. Couple that with areas of town where blacks were not welcomed, and it only made it harder for blacks to get jobs.

By about this time, there were riots in Chicago where blacks were rebelling from the constant racism and lack of employment. Also at this point the police would harass black people outside of their neighborhoods. The riots happened in black neighborhoods and it only made poverty worse. At that point the city stopped spending as much money or police time in the black areas of town. With the poverty, gangs began to increase in importance. There was some cross over with the black power movement as well. These gangs did not only give younger black men a group of friends and an identity, but they also gave them a way to make money through the sell and distribution of drugs.

At this time local officials in Chicago were concerned about the growing presence of these powerful gangs in Chicago and their drug dealing. Starting with Nixon, the US declared a war on drugs, which really meant a war on the black gangs in Chicago.

The police began arresting some of the black gang leaders in Chicago, which caused a power vacuum in the city and caused gangs to fight even more for turf. Illinois responded by making drug laws more harsh. As a result you had multiple generations of black men in prison for long periods of time. That caused more poverty and families to break down. 

By the 1990's the city of Chicago largely viewed these black neighborhoods as outside of Chicago. They were dehumanized and avoided. People were accepting of their neighborhoods being safe and would just avoid Cabrini Green/ Robert Taylor. So there was little call for the police to do much in these neighborhoods. As a result guns were used by local gangs to enforce their rule.

The cities response with the police force was to go no further than attack and try the top gang leaders and the dealers and gang members. Also at this same time the mayor was sick of the black eye caused my these large housing projects, plus businesses wanted the land as it was close to the city. So yet again the blacks were pushed out into a number of neighborhoods. This only diluted the gang leadership further.

So by the 2010's the city basically had incarcerated 3-4 generations of black men. So you have boys being raised by single mothers and their neighborhoods. Even the possible male role models that were older gangsters were dead or in prison.

So now you have chaos. There are kids with no real leadership running around and shooting each other with less money to chase in the drug game too. You have black young men that grew up without a father or uncles, with family friends in jail and older siblings that dealt drugs and used guns.... so that is what they learned. The idea of staying in school doesn't work because each school has multiple gangs.

So now these kids hang out on the block, chill with their friends that are in their gangs, have some side hustles and beef online with one another until someone decided to shoot someone, usually in a drive by. It makes the news, but the white people do not really care because it isn't their neighborhood or family. 

So it is has been a perfect storm that has resulted in gun violence. The federal government and the city of Chicago are talking about getting higher resolution cameras and putting them all over Garfield Park, Lawn, Engle, Austin ...... that would go a long way in getting those in drive by shootings arrested because they will get license plates...... but the gangs will adjust and steal rides to do it.

It is really simple, as soon as white people are serious about wanting to stop the problem, it will stop because they have the money and power. Right now what you are seeing in Chicago is largely the result of white people that don't live in the area making the rules and making it worse...... you isolate a group of people in an area of town, take away their jobs, give them terrible educational chances, make drug dealing attractive, dehumanize them and put their elders in prison....... this is what happens, a bunch of young bucks shoot shit up.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
931,"A follow-up study in 1998 by Arthur Kellermann analyzed 626 shootings in three cities.

Our Democracy has been shit since before Trump ever got in office, Liberals only seem to care when it's Republicans doing the shitting, but I'm pretty sure GWB and Obama shat all over our Democracy, they were just ""presidential"" about it.

They most definitely deserve it, because they voted for it.

Edit: And if you don't believe me, here's why I'm not going to bother voting this year: https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/

&gt;Hold gun manufacturers accountable.

AKA you should be able to sue Remington because someone used one of their guns to kill someone, which Remington doesn't even advocate.

&gt;Get weapons of war off our streets.

More gibberish, the only ""weapons of war"" on the streets are those toted by the DEA.

&gt;Ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. 

AKA Make sure only the State has firepower and you don't.

&gt;Regulate possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act.

AKA Pay for the ""privilege"" of owning a firearm AND it be registered. Registration leads to confiscation every time.

&gt;Buy back the assault weapons and high-capacity magazines already in our communities. 

AKA Theft. You can't ""buy back"" that which you never owned in the first place.

&gt;Reduce stockpiling of weapons.

AKA more loophole jumping and making it harder to be ""law abiding"" therefore making more non-criminal gun owners into criminals.

&gt;End the online sale of firearms and ammunitions.

AKA funneling purchases into ""approved"" gun stores. And guess what happens when the State closes them? No more guns and ammo and parts for you! DC in case you don't know.

&gt;Incentivize state “extreme risk” laws. 

AKA No due process

&gt;Give states incentives to set up gun licensing programs.

AKA paying for the ""privilege"" of owning a gun which is already a right.

&gt;Establish a new Task Force on Online Harassment and Abuse to focus on the connection between mass shootings, online harassment, extremism, and violence against women.

AKA making Facebook and google and company spy on you for ""wrong think"". You don't like the police? You get flagged and can't buy a gun.

&gt;Put America on the path to ensuring that 100% of firearms sold in America are smart guns.

More registration and confiscation, and now with the added bonus of your gun not working when it needs to.

&gt;Require gun owners to safely store their weapons.

""safe storage"" means you can't get access to guns when you need them in your home.

&gt;Require firearms owners to report if their weapon is lost or stolen.

Registration and confiscation

&gt;Stop “ghost guns.”

Registration and confiscation

&gt;Dedicate the brightest scientific minds to solving the gun violence public health epidemic.

It's not a public health epidemic, and it's weaponizing the CDC to support dubious ""gun control"" polices. The 2013 study that everyone loves to tout showed that gun control doesn't do anything significant to curb gun violence.

&gt;Prohibit the use of federal funds to arm or train educators to discharge firearms.

AKA no more gun safety training. Which is hilarious since they want gun owners to be responsible. Now they just want them untrained.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
938,"&gt; There's more gun violence in the US than anywhere else that I know of,

Yes, but is concentrated within poor and minority communities suggesting it isn't gun availability, but issues endemic to being poor and oppressed for centuries.

I know in the UK or Norway it would be a stupid argument, but that’s because guns aren’t prolific.

And to be honest these what if scenario is are stupid. You either have the right to reply to violence with equal force or you don’t. The gun is only used in the case of life threatening violence. You don’t think people have the right to defend their life?",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

944,"&gt;”All either of us have are anecdotes though. Regarding evidence, you have every other country in the world with gun bans and statistics regarding violence and guns in those countries.”

And when you statistically compare them there isn’t any statistical correlation between violence and gun ownership. That statement is not an anecdote. Pointing out specific countries who have vast cultural and societal differences as an argument for or against gun ownership would be an anecdote. 

&gt;”As a counter to those facts, I see, in a nutshell ""you can't get rid of guns, people will just import them or make them, and violence will continue with knives anyway"" which really just means no point trying to better society.”

No, It doesn’t mean there’s no point trying to better society, just that this one specific method doesn’t work. 

For example I’m going to guess we’d both agree changing our criminal system to try to rehabilitate (where it makes sense to like petty crimes) instead of just punish would be a benefit to society. 

&gt;”But at least you can all feel safe and secure at home while your children go off to school, or music festivals, or the movies.”

I mean... you are safe for those events. You’re more likely to win the lottery on the same day as being struck by lightning than you are to be victim of a mass shooting if that’s what you’re getting at. Not to mention, in America I’m allowed to carry a tool to defend myself in most places.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

946,"As somebody who has lived in such a country before (Although not right now, I'm back in Canada) it wouldn't work in America. Too many of you are armed, violence against police is too common. I know already you'll predictably quote back that policework isn't even a top 5 dangerous job in terms of death in the US, but I'll counter by pointing out that at least part of that is likely due to the fact they can in fact shoot back, I've seen enough videos over the years of police shooting a criminal who was indeed firing on them in the USA, something that basically never happens (or almost never) in most of those other countries you're talking about.'

So here's what you can do if you want to be like many of those other nations like the UK, Japan, New Zealand (where I lived!) etc. You can fight to remove the second amendment, disarm most of your population and then disarm your beat cops.

Violence is the only thing that has ever made America change.  I don't advocate or condone violence but read history.  Read up on how just by arming themselves, the Black Panthers got gun reform laws passed.

It's so American, it's the 2nd Amendment.

Martin Luther King was nonviolent; he was universally hated at the time and they murdered him.

Looting and destruction of property and arming one's self seems to be the only things this country cares about enough to make societal change.

They are the country with the lowest rates of paid pat/mat leave, paid vacation/holidays, affordable medical care or medication. 20% of Americans can’t point to Japan on a map. Parts of America have homicide rates that match or exceed South American drug war countries. There are several American cities without drinkable tap water. America has the highest rate of illiteracy out of any western country. America has the highest rate of police brutality out of any western country. It is still an active conversation on whether or not LGBTQ+ should be protected under discrimination laws and whether or not women should be allowed to have abortions. American children are now taught how to react in school shootings the same way and to the same frequency other western school children are taught fire drills. 

The only “freedom” America has that most countries do not have is the ‘freedom to bare arms’ and even that Canada does better than them with less gun violence and virtually no mass shootings. 

IMO America is no more and no less freedom than other countries but it does have a hell of a lot less education, care, comfort, work-life balance, and security than every other western country.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
953,"I think a lot of the cognitive dissonance works like this:

If you enjoy owning guns, you want to believe that gun ownership can't be the source of our epidemic of gun violence, so you refuse to believe that it is the cause. And then you are left scrambling and then claim things like:

* no, gun ownership doesn't cause gun violence, the problem is mental illness
* no, gun ownership doesn't cause gun violence, poverty is the problem
* no, gun ownership doesn't cause gun violence, criminals do
* and for the racists: gun ownership doesn't cause gun violence, non-white people do
* and if none of that works, just say: it is impossible to do anything about gun ownership or gun violence, so shut up.

They'll grab on to pretty much any cause that isn't the obvious one right in front of them. The argument they embrace does not have to make sense, it just has to excuse them from contemplating that the thing they enjoy is the primary source of gun violence in America.

957,"you can’t just swap races and expect everything to remain equal it doesn’t work like that. the police and justice system have much harsher penalties for minorities. So if the situation was reversed and a black woman was accused of knocking over a young white girl, intentionally or not, the black woman should be reasonably more afraid of escalating the situation and having the police come. As it is the police also historically facilitate and overlook white on black crime, so the fact that this white lady feels so entitled to just ignore these people she’s crossed, try to leave, and then draw on them, is justified by her white privileged. however, in america with his history of lynchings and soft-sentences for whites, were a black lady to be harangued with the threat of calling the police (like the white gun nut was) that black lady would have a greater reason to fear violence because of context. i’m not saying that would justify getting out of a car and pulling a piece, and i don’t think anybody would, but if the races are swapped it’s an entirely different situation. i just don’t understand how you can compare them. 

the context means that the actions of a white person and the actions of a black person are not similarly judged, so in any given situation a black person does not enjoy the same privilege to behave exactly as a white person might be allowed.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
958,"* **Gun are Used Defensively by American Citizens Everyday**

Due to its nature figures on defensive gun use are hard to nail down. Typically when a firearm is used defensively no one is hurt and rarely is anyone killed. Often times simply showing you are armed is enough to end a crime in  progress. Looking at the numbers even the [Violence Policy Center](http://www.vpc.org/studies/justifiable19.pdf), a gun control advocacy group, reports 177,330 instances of self defense against a violent crime with a firearm between 2014 and 2016. This translates to 56,110 violent crimes prevented annually on the low scale. This also doesn't include property crimes which include home burglaries which increase that number to over 300,000 defensive gun uses between 2014 to 2016 or over 100,000 annually.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
959,"I've been down this debate road before and I expect similar results here: nothing. I only tell you this because going down this line of conversation is very frequently the equivalent of me beating my head against a wall. Because of the futility of it I can come off as mean/trollish. Since you responded with a reasonable and civil comment my intent is to do the same, so if at any point I seem angry or frustrated please know that it's not what I'm trying to do. 

First and foremost you need to realize that we are two very different cultures. I grew up around guns and the second amendment. You (I assume) grew up in Britain where guns are seen as a liability above all else. This causes both of us to view this topic in extremely different ways. So what I'd ask of you is to pause when you come to something that you think is absurd and ask if perhaps my opinion isn't wrong but your world view of my opinion says it's wrong (I hope that makes sense, I'm a tad buzzed). 

Talking about the medical malpractice portion, that piece is brought up because of how our anti-gun lobbyists frame the necessity to eliminate guns. Their message is essentially ""it will save lives"". If that was their sole purpose why wouldn't they focus on a myriad of other issues (like malpractice, fast food, smoking and drugs) that kill way more people? The sad truth is, it's not really about saving people it's about making money and winning elections. 

It's not in the statistical breakdown but the overwhelming majority of all gun deaths are from pistols. Yet our media and their darlings are constantly beating the war drums of ""AR-15 BAD!!!"". Just to amuse myself once I looked up the dumbest way to die I could think of which turned out to be falling out of bed. Interestingly I found that dying from falling out of bed kills more people a year than ALL deaths from a rifle (bolt action, black powder, semi-autos...). Yet the AR-15 is seen as the scariest gun imaginable and eliminating it is the focal point of our left's anti-gun agenda.

Now onto suicide. The break down was specifically for ""gun violence"" because that's how our media talks about it. By any reasonable definition a suicide by gun isn't ""gun violence"" that's why it is excluded. Now does easier access to guns mean more people kill themselves with it? Undeniably, yes. Does that mean we should ban guns outright? Unequivocally, no and I'll get to that in the end. Suicide is a tough issue to tackle in society and will never go away. However, my personal belief is that what our current schools and some parents are doing to make life easier for kids (safe spaces and lack of discipline especially) will equate to a skyrocketing suicide in a decade or less. 

As for our law enforcement, they are criminally undertrained. Our cops get some weapons training and almost no physical combat training. So, that equates to an officer relying on his gun more often than is necessary. It's sad but I'd rather see an officer return home to his/her family than the criminal. Also, the narrative for anti-gunners is based around criminals shooting innocents, therefore cops would not be part of the equation. 

At the end of it all though it comes down to one simple fact, humans can not be trusted with power. We've seen it all over the world throughout history that someone gains power and slaughters millions. Our second amendment is for just that reason. People like to say President Trump is a fascist dictator. If that where true, what could Americans do assuming there weren't guns? Fuck all, that's what. Going back to suicides, sure your brother took his life with his gun and that's  tragic but your sister shot her would-be rapist in the face and never got violated. Everyone likes to point out the 30,000 lives taken stat but few bother mentioning the 50,000-3,000,000 stat of lives saved (technically it's defensive gun uses and the most reasonable stat I've found has it at 100,000). 

Hopefully it didnt get to rambling. I'm typing this on my phone and got tired about half way through. In summary though, America has guns because the government sucks and can never be trusted. People die every day for one reason or another and to ban the one freedom that protects all other freedoms because of a few tragedies is just inviting tyranny.",-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3 more REALLY loud shots causing my erection to

dissapear.

Now, at this point I was just pissed off because some

from him.

I can't fit all the reasons why into one tweet, but to put it simply, most gun control measures would end up doing little to prevent gun violence in the US.
